Trademarks and service marks\u2014or simply, \u201cmarks\u201d\u2014reinforce our brand reputation and enable clients to feel confident in choosing our products and services over those of our competitors. By reserving Morningstar\u2019s legal rights to a specific word, phrase, symbol, or design, these marks also protect our brands and related assets from misappropriation by others.\nA trademark helps identify and distinguish the goods or services of one party from those of another. In the United States, Morningstar uses three different symbols to designate the legal status of a mark: trademark, service mark, and registered trademark.\nA trademark, or \u2122 designator, is used to claim trademark rights in the name of a product or tangible good until such time as one chooses to register it with the applicable government.\nA service mark, or \u2120 designator, is used to claim service mark rights in the name of a service, including a service offered over the web, until such time as one chooses to register it with the applicable government.\nThe registered trademark, or \u00ae designator, indicates that a product or service name has been formally registered with the applicable government. Trademark registrations are usually done on a country-by-country basis.\nNote that most countries outside of the U.S. ignore the distinction between trademarks and service marks and just use the \u2122 designator for all unregistered marks.\nFor country-specific use cases, see the Registered Trademarks section.\nOur core brand assets include the Morningstar name, family brand names, the Morningstar logotype and lockups (combined wordmarks of Morningstar logotype and family brand names), as well as signature assets, like our Moat Ratings. Our regulated entity names and some offering names may also be treated as brand assets.\nWe distinguish between our use of Morningstar brand assets and their use by others, including partners, licensees, and media. See the Using marks for Morningstar brand assets by all third parties section.\nExcept in certain limited instances, the Morningstar brand name is a separate mark that is distinct from the names of products, features, and supporting elements. In the United States and most other jurisdictions in which Morningstar does business, the Morningstar brand name is a registered trademark.\nSimilarly, our logotype is typically a registered mark and the anchor of our visual identity, and it is part of our lockups, which are used for family brands only.\nOur family brands are Morningstar Credit, Morningstar Data+Analytics, Morningstar ESG, Morningstar Indexes, Morningstar Retirement, and Morningstar Wealth.\nNote that the family brands are not legal entities, and they should never be used instead of legal entities in any documentation that supports a legal process, like contracts, service agreements, or partnership agreements.\nAcross jurisdictions where we operate, there may be differences in how we refer to regulated entities in sales/marketing materials and legal disclosures or other legal documentation.\nIn some cases, we have registered the names of certain products and services in the United States and other jurisdictions as trademarks. For a current list, see the Registered Trademarks section.\nOn first use, all third parties are required to include:\nWhen using the logotype, third parties must ensure the legibility of the registered trademark symbol.\nSee the Registered Trademarks section for the full list of registered trademarks and how to represent them in each jurisdiction.\nIn the tables below, you\u2019ll find the registered trademark status for commonly used names by country or region.\nThe \u00ae designator associated with the \u201cMorningstar\u201d mark (both word and design marks, in black and in red) may only be used in EU countries and the United Kingdom. The \u00ae designator associated with the \u201cMorningstar\u201d word mark in black may also be used in Guernsey and Jersey. The \u00ae designator associated with the \u201cMorningstar\u201d design mark may also be used in Iceland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Norway, Russia, Serbia, and Switzerland.\nAny use of these marks in any other European jurisdiction should only be given the \u2122 designator. Please modify the marks below as necessary depending on the location of their use.\nThe \u00ae designator associated with the \u201cMorningstar\u201d word mark currently may only be used in India, Indonesia, Kuwait, Malaysia, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Taiwan, and United Arab Emirates. The \u00ae designator may be used with both the \u201cMorningstar\u201d word and design marks in Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, and South Korea. In China, Singapore, Thailand, and Turkey, the \u00ae designator should only be used with the design mark.\nAny use of this mark in any other Asian, Middle Eastern, or African country should only be given the \u2122 designator. Please modify the marks below as necessary depending on the location of their use.\nThe \u00ae designator associated with the \u201cMorningstar\u201d word mark currently may be used in Argentina, Bermuda, and Peru. The \u00ae designator associated with the \u201cMorningstar\u201d word and design marks may be used in Brazil, Chile, and Mexico. In Panama, the \u00ae designator may only be used with the \u201cMorningstar\u201d design mark.\nAny use of this mark in any other Latin American country should only be given the \u2122 designator.

These are not legal entities and should not replace legal entity names in contractual documents.\n\n5. **Registration and Symbol Use by Region**: The document provides guidance on the use of trademarks across various regions:\n   - In the EU and UK, both word and design marks can use the \u00ae symbol.\n   - In certain Asian, Middle Eastern, and African countries, there are specific guidelines for using the \u00ae symbol with the word and design marks.\n   - For Latin American countries, the use of symbols varies, with guidelines for specific countries like Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico.\n\nOverall, the document outlines how Morningstar protects its brand through trademarks and how these marks should be used globally, ensuring legal compliance and consistent brand representation."

The company is assessing the effectiveness of its One Key loyalty program before expanding it internationally. Recent financial results show growth across Expedia's consumer brands and B2B segment, with notable increases in bookings, net income, and advertising revenue.\nWhat's Expedia Group's stance on partnership with AI answer engines?\nCEO Ariane Gorin told analysts Thursday that in addition to further personalizing the customer experience on Expedia websites through AI features, the company is open to AI partnerships for its B2B business.\n\"Going forward, we'll continue to test and release AI-generated features to further personalize our traveler experience,\" Gorin said during the company's fourth quarter and full-year earnings call. \"AI also opens new possibilities to drive traffic to our brands as consumers increasingly search in new GenAI-native experiences, and we're ensuring that we meet them where they are. And for our B2B business, the AI-native travel startups that will inevitably emerge present new partnership opportunities for us.\"\nSeveral travel brands, including Booking.com, Priceline, OpenTable, Tripadvisor, Hipcamp and Uber recently partnered with OpenAI. Expedia brands weren't in the mix, and that issue didn't come up during the call.\nAs with online travel companies stance on working with Google Hotels or Google Vacation Rentals, some may forego partnering with the likes of OpenAi, Google's Gemini, or other emerging answer engines. So it wasn't a slam dunk that Expedia would be looking to do so.\nExpedia three main consumer brands, Expedia, Hotels.com and Vrbo, all experienced growth in 2024, as did its B2B and advertising businesses.\nGorin acknowledged that the company still has work to do to accelerate its Hotels.com and Vrbo vacation rental businesses.\nStill, the company intends to look opportunistically at M&A.\nScott Schenkel, appearing in his first earnings call as Expedia Group's chief financial officer said:  \"Look, I'm coming in new here. But I think any time a company is at our scale and our technology base, we should be in the market and looking at M&A. And I think they've been and will continue to be.\"\nGorin said the company has a team focused on deals.\n\"Right now, we continue to be focused on running the brands that we have, growing the B2B business, the advertising business and continuing to have strong returns,\" Gorin said.\nWhen Expedia Group launched its One Key loyalty program in 2023 under previous CEO Peter Kern, the plan was to roll out the program internationally. One year later, however, Gorin paused One Key's expansion beyond the U.S. and UK.\nShe said yesterday that the company's teams are evaluating the impact of the loyalty program and next steps.\nThe teams know that One Key has been positive for Expedia and it's been a drag on bookings for Hotels.com,\" Gorin said.\nHotels.com had a simple loyalty program that was arguably more attractive for its customers than is One Key.\nGorin said the company is also assessing the impact of enabling guests to earn One Key cash on virtually all of Vrbo bookings.\n\"So we're going to take all of those learnings and then look by brand and geography what we need to do in loyalty, and we'll share more in the year to come,\" Gorin said.\nAll three of Expedia Group's core consumer brands saw bookings growth in the fourth quarter, and as a whole gross bookings climbed 5 points to 9%.\nGorin said the company's B2B business had a \"stellar\" fourth quarter, with gross bookings up 24% year over year.\nExpedia Group's advertising revenue jumped 24% for full-year 2024.\nNet income in the fourth quarter increased 124% to $299 million. Revenue jumped 10% to nearly $3.2 billion.\nExpedia Group's share price was up nearly 9% to $172 in after-hours trading Thursday evening.\nTags: dwell, earnings, expedia, hotels.com, online travel newsletter, short-term rentals, very online, vrbo\nPhoto Credit: Expedia Group CEO Ariane Gorin at the 2024 Skift Global Forum.\u00a0Skift\nSubscribe today to keep up with the latest travel industry news.\nAlready a subscriber?

Despite this growth, the company acknowledges the need for further efforts in accelerating its Hotels.com and Vrbo divisions.\n\nExpedia is also considering mergers and acquisitions (M&A) as part of its strategic initiatives.

Trademarks and service marks\u2014or simply, \u201cmarks\u201d\u2014reinforce our brand reputation and enable clients to feel confident in choosing our products and services over those of our competitors. By reserving Morningstar\u2019s legal rights to a specific word, phrase, symbol, or design, these marks also protect our brands and related assets from misappropriation by others.\nA trademark helps identify and distinguish the goods or services of one party from those of another. In the United States, Morningstar uses three different symbols to designate the legal status of a mark: trademark, service mark, and registered trademark.\nA trademark, or \u2122 designator, is used to claim trademark rights in the name of a product or tangible good until such time as one chooses to register it with the applicable government.\nA service mark, or \u2120 designator, is used to claim service mark rights in the name of a service, including a service offered over the web, until such time as one chooses to register it with the applicable government.\nThe registered trademark, or \u00ae designator, indicates that a product or service name has been formally registered with the applicable government. Trademark registrations are usually done on a country-by-country basis.\nNote that most countries outside of the U.S. ignore the distinction between trademarks and service marks and just use the \u2122 designator for all unregistered marks.\nFor country-specific use cases, see the Registered Trademarks section.\nOur core brand assets include the Morningstar name, family brand names, the Morningstar logotype and lockups (combined wordmarks of Morningstar logotype and family brand names), as well as signature assets, like our Moat Ratings. Our regulated entity names and some offering names may also be treated as brand assets.\nWe distinguish between our use of Morningstar brand assets and their use by others, including partners, licensees, and media. See the Using marks for Morningstar brand assets by all third parties section.\nExcept in certain limited instances, the Morningstar brand name is a separate mark that is distinct from the names of products, features, and supporting elements. In the United States and most other jurisdictions in which Morningstar does business, the Morningstar brand name is a registered trademark.\nSimilarly, our logotype is typically a registered mark and the anchor of our visual identity, and it is part of our lockups, which are used for family brands only.\nOur family brands are Morningstar Credit, Morningstar Data+Analytics, Morningstar ESG, Morningstar Indexes, Morningstar Retirement, and Morningstar Wealth.\nNote that the family brands are not legal entities, and they should never be used instead of legal entities in any documentation that supports a legal process, like contracts, service agreements, or partnership agreements.\nAcross jurisdictions where we operate, there may be differences in how we refer to regulated entities in sales/marketing materials and legal disclosures or other legal documentation.\nIn some cases, we have registered the names of certain products and services in the United States and other jurisdictions as trademarks.

The \u00ae designator may be used with both the \u201cMorningstar\u201d word and design marks in Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, and South Korea.

The company is assessing the effectiveness of its One Key loyalty program before expanding it internationally. Recent financial results show growth across Expedia's consumer brands and B2B segment, with notable increases in bookings, net income, and advertising revenue.\nWhat's Expedia Group's stance on partnership with AI answer engines?\nCEO Ariane Gorin told analysts Thursday that in addition to further personalizing the customer experience on Expedia websites through AI features, the company is open to AI partnerships for its B2B business.\n\"Going forward, we'll continue to test and release AI-generated features to further personalize our traveler experience,\" Gorin said during the company's fourth quarter and full-year earnings call. \"AI also opens new possibilities to drive traffic to our brands as consumers increasingly search in new GenAI-native experiences, and we're ensuring that we meet them where they are. And for our B2B business, the AI-native travel startups that will inevitably emerge present new partnership opportunities for us.\"\nSeveral travel brands, including Booking.com, Priceline, OpenTable, Tripadvisor, Hipcamp and Uber recently partnered with OpenAI. Expedia brands weren't in the mix, and that issue didn't come up during the call.\nAs with online travel companies stance on working with Google Hotels or Google Vacation Rentals, some may forego partnering with the likes of OpenAi, Google's Gemini, or other emerging answer engines. So it wasn't a slam dunk that Expedia would be looking to do so.\nExpedia three main consumer brands, Expedia, Hotels.com and Vrbo, all experienced growth in 2024, as did its B2B and advertising businesses.\nGorin acknowledged that the company still has work to do to accelerate its Hotels.com and Vrbo vacation rental businesses.\nStill, the company intends to look opportunistically at M&A.\nScott Schenkel, appearing in his first earnings call as Expedia Group's chief financial officer said:  \"Look, I'm coming in new here. But I think any time a company is at our scale and our technology base, we should be in the market and looking at M&A. And I think they've been and will continue to be.\"\nGorin said the company has a team focused on deals.\n\"Right now, we continue to be focused on running the brands that we have, growing the B2B business, the advertising business and continuing to have strong returns,\" Gorin said.\nWhen Expedia Group launched its One Key loyalty program in 2023 under previous CEO Peter Kern, the plan was to roll out the program internationally. One year later, however, Gorin paused One Key's expansion beyond the U.S. and UK.\nShe said yesterday that the company's teams are evaluating the impact of the loyalty program and next steps.\nThe teams know that One Key has been positive for Expedia and it's been a drag on bookings for Hotels.com,\" Gorin said.\nHotels.com had a simple loyalty program that was arguably more attractive for its customers than is One Key.\nGorin said the company is also assessing the impact of enabling guests to earn One Key cash on virtually all of Vrbo bookings.\n\"So we're going to take all of those learnings and then look by brand and geography what we need to do in loyalty, and we'll share more in the year to come,\" Gorin said.\nAll three of Expedia Group's core consumer brands saw bookings growth in the fourth quarter, and as a whole gross bookings climbed 5 points to 9%.\nGorin said the company's B2B business had a \"stellar\" fourth quarter, with gross bookings up 24% year over year.\nExpedia Group's advertising revenue jumped 24% for full-year 2024.\nNet income in the fourth quarter increased 124% to $299 million. Revenue jumped 10% to nearly $3.2 billion.\nExpedia Group's share price was up nearly 9% to $172 in after-hours trading Thursday evening.\nTags: dwell, earnings, expedia, hotels.com, online travel newsletter, short-term rentals, very online, vrbo\nPhoto Credit: Expedia Group CEO Ariane Gorin at the 2024 Skift Global Forum.\u00a0Skift\nSubscribe today to keep up with the latest travel industry news.\nAlready a subscriber?

CEO Ariane Gorin emphasized the company's openness to collaborating with AI-driven innovations, seeing potential in AI-native travel startups for partnerships. While numerous travel brands have partnered with OpenAI, Expedia's stance remains cautious, paralleling the industry's tentative approach to potential collaborations with entities like OpenAI or Google's emerging AI engines.\n\nIn its financial report, Expedia highlighted growth in its consumer brands (Expedia, Hotels.com, and Vrbo) and its B2B segment, noting significant increases in bookings, net income, and advertising revenue. Despite this growth, the company acknowledges the need for further efforts in accelerating its Hotels.com and Vrbo divisions.\n\nExpedia is also considering mergers and acquisitions (M&A) as part of its strategic initiatives. CFO Scott Schenkel and CEO Gorin both highlighted the company's proactive approach in exploring potential deals in the market.\n\nThe company is evaluating the One Key loyalty program launched in 2023 and has currently suspended its international expansion while assessing its impact, especially on Hotels.com. Moving forward, Expedia plans to analyze brand-specific and regional strategies for its loyalty programs.\n\nFinancially, Expedia experienced a robust fourth quarter with a 5% increase in gross bookings, a \"stellar\" 24% rise in B2B bookings, a 24% growth in advertising revenue, and a 124% increase in net income, leading to a significant rise in its share price."

We encourage writers of all skill levels, and from all backgrounds, to pitch us. We are especially interested in hearing from writers with backgrounds that are traditionally under-represented in technology and science journalism, and from outside the United States.\nThis guide will give you a brief overview of the kinds of stories we run, what we’re looking for in a pitch, and who to contact when you have an idea.\nMost of the stories that MIT Technology Review commissions come from pitches, but we do reach out to writers with assignments. We also issue a bi-monthly call for pitches for the print magazine. If you’d like to be considered for assignments and be informed of calls for pitches, you can fill out this form to be added to our database of freelance journalists.\nWhat is an MIT Technology Review story?\nMIT Technology Review publishes a wide range of stories, from breaking news to long-term investigations. We want stories about technology itself, but we’re particularly excited about those areas where technology and humans collide—where technology meets the real world. Our stories should feel like must-reads for people who want to stay up to date with how technology is changing our world.\nIn general, we commission news stories (generally 800-1,000 words), analysis pieces (800-1,000 words), and features (2,500-4,000 words) from freelancers for the website. The print magazine offers other potential formats for stories in addition to news and features, including infographics and data spreads, essays, short profiles, and book reviews. If you are an expert interested in writing an op-ed for the magazine, you can find more information on the op-ed pitching and writing process here.\nWhat makes a good MIT Technology Review pitch?\nA pitch does not need to be long, but it should contain enough information to give the commissioning editor a good sense of what the end product would look like. A good pitch will tell us why our readers should care about your idea and why they should be reading about it now. It should also show how you (the writer) will make the story an enjoyable read.\nIn general, there has to be a sense of urgency and a clear top line. Pitching to write about a topic isn’t enough: What is the story you’re going to tell us? What kind of take-away should readers have? One way to do this is to think about what the headline might be. You can look at our site to get a sense of how we write our headlines (for example, we generally avoid formulating headlines as questions).\nPlease check to see if we have published similar stories recently. If it is an idea that hasn’t been covered by us but has been covered well by other outlets, explain how your story would stand apart.\nAnd if you have not written for MIT Technology Review before, be sure to introduce yourself and include links to a few relevant clips if you have them.\nNews and analysis stories\nIf you’re pitching a news story about a scientific or technological development, be sure to make clear why this advance (if it is an advance) is important and not just incremental. It can’t be significant only to researchers in the field: it has to be important to people in general. They should be able to read the story and instantly get a sense as to why it’s a big deal.\nIn addition to straight news stories, we sometimes commission analysis pieces from freelance writers (examples here, here and here) that look at the news of the day through a new lens, adding context, insight, or new information to take the story forward.\nWe’d want a quick pitch (and a quick turnaround) for such analysis pieces. Summing up what is already out there isn’t enough; you need to tell us what the new thing is you’re bringing to the story. What do people not know? What are the consequences of the event that many of our readers will be unaware of—but would be fascinated to learn about?\nFeatures and essays\nFeatures can take a wide range of possible approaches, including profiles, narrative features, and deep investigations. Ultimately, readers should enjoy reading them. So your pitch should not only explain what the story is and why it is important but show how you’d tell it in a compelling way.\nFeature pitches should have a specific story to tell—it is not enough to pitch an interesting topic. You must explain what kind of approach you’d take, what kind of ride you’ll take readers on. Who are the main characters? What obstacles or challenges will they meet on the way? How might your story resolve? What is the nut graf? We don’t expect you to have everything worked out in advance of reporting and writing the story, but the pitch should be able to give a sense of where the story will go.\nSimilarly, pitches for essays need a clear argument. Explain what you want to say about the topic in hand, why you're qualified to write about it, what take-aways you hope to give readers, and the evidence you will marshal to make your case.\nPitching for print\nMIT Technology Review publishes a bi-monthly print magazine. We run short news stories and profiles (500-800 words), op-eds, and data spreads in the front of the book and essays and book reviews in the back of the book (usually around 2000 words).\nThe feature well of the magazine is devoted to narrative features, investigations, big profiles, and reported essays (generally between 2500-4000 words). Our features in each issue are centered around a theme.\nHere are the upcoming themes for 2025. Please note that specific pitch deadlines will be announced over e-mail. You can add yourself to the freelance database through the form linked at the top of this page to get the official call for pitches for each issue:\nHow much does MIT Technology Review pay?\nRates range from $1 to $2 per word, depending on the experience level of the writer, the story, and the publication route. Deeply reported features pay more than shorter news pieces.\nWho do I pitch to?\nIf you have any questions or if you are ready to send a pitch, please reach out to commissioning editor Rachel Courtland (rachel.courtland@technologyreview.com). Please be sure to include “PITCH” in the subject line of your email. We prefer pitches to be within the body of an e-mail instead of as an attachment."], 'https://mediakit.technologyreview.com/': ['', ''], 'https://www.instagram.com/technologyreview/': 'Error: Could not find an article title', 'https://www.reddit.com/user/techreview/': ['MIT Technology Review', "u/techreview\nSubreddit to discuss ChatGPT and AI.

There’s a whole lot of speculation about how far these actions reach, which ones might get overturned, and generally what comes next. Here are some of the crucial threads that I’m going to be following.\nIt’s clear that Donald Trump isn’t a fan of electric vehicles. One of the executive orders issued on his first day in office promised to eliminate the “electric vehicle (EV) mandate.”\nThe federal government under Biden didn’t actually have an EV mandate in place—rather, Trump is targeting national support programs, including subsidies that lower the cost of EVs for drivers and support building public chargers. But that’s just the beginning, because the executive order will go after states that have set their own rules on EVs.\nWhile the US Environmental Protection Agency does set some rules around EVs through what are called tailpipe standards, last year California was granted a waiver that allows the state to set its own, stricter rules. The state now requires that all vehicles sold there must be zero-emissions by 2035. More than a dozen states quickly followed suit, setting a target to transition to zero-emissions vehicles within the next decade. That commitment was a major signal to automakers that there will be demand for EVs, and a lot of it, soon.\nTrump appears to be coming after that waiver, and with it California’s right to set its own targets on EVs. We’ll likely see court battles over this, and experts aren’t sure how it’s going to shake out.\nWind energy was one of the most explicit targets for Trump on the campaign trail and during his first few days in office. In one memo, the new administration paused all federal permits, leases, and loans for all offshore and onshore wind projects.\nThis doesn’t just affect projects on federal lands or waters—nearly all wind projects typically require federal permits, so this could have a wide effect.\nEven if the order is temporary or doesn’t hold up in court, it could be enough to chill investment in a sector that’s already been on shaky ground. As I reported last year, rising costs and slow timelines were already throwing offshore wind projects off track in the US. Investment has slowed since I published that story, and now, with growing political opposition, things could get even rockier.\nOne major question is how much this will slow down existing projects, like the Lava Ridge Wind Project in Idaho, which got the green light from the Biden administration before he left office. As one source told the Washington Post, the new administration may try to go after leases and permits that have already been issued, but “there may be insufficient authority to do so.”\nIn an executive order last week, the Trump administration called for a pause on handing out the funds that are legally set aside under the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. That includes hundreds of billions of dollars for climate research and infrastructure.\nThis week, a memo from the White House called for a wider pause on federal grants and loans. This goes way beyond climate spending and could affect programs like Medicaid. There’s been chaos since that was first reported; nobody seems to agree on what exactly will be affected or how long the pause was supposed to last, and as of Tuesday evening, a federal judge had blocked that order.\nIn any case, all these efforts to pause, slow, or stop federal spending will be a major source of fighting going forward. As for effects on climate technology, I think the biggest question is how far the new administration can and will go to block spending that’s already been designated by Congress. There could be political consequences—most funds from the Inflation Reduction Act have gone to conservative-leaning states.\nAs I wrote just after the election in November, Donald Trump’s return to office means a sharp turn for the US on climate policy, and we’re seeing that start to play out very quickly. I’ll be following it all, but I’d love to hear from you. What do you most want to know more about? What questions do you have? If you work in the climate sector, how are you seeing your job affected? You can email me at casey.crownhart@technologyreview.com, message me on Bluesky, or reach me on Signal: @casey.131.\nEVs are mostly set for solid growth this year, but what happens in the US is still yet to be seen, as my colleague James Temple covered in a recent story.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act set aside hundreds of billions of dollars for climate spending. Here’s how the law made a difference, two years in.\nFor more on Trump’s first week in office, check out this news segment from Science Friday (featuring yours truly).\nDeepSeek has stormed onto the AI scene. The company released a new reasoning model, called DeepSeek R1, which it claims can surpass the performance of OpenAI’s ChatGPT o1. The model appears to be incredibly efficient, which upends the idea that huge amounts of computing power, and energy, are needed to drive the AI revolution.\nFor more, check out this story on the company and its model from my colleague Caiwei Chen, and this look at what it means for the AI industry and its energy claims from James O’Donnell.\nA huge surge in clean energy caused China’s carbon emissions to level off in 2024.

The guiding principles are based on our responsibility to the reader to produce accurate, fair, and independent editorial. This means, among other things, following the guidelines set by the American Society of Magazine Editors (ASME) for digital and print publications.\na. Sources. It also means adhering to conventional journalistic standards covering attribution and sourcing of information. Our standard practice is to gather information directly from those involved in creating, financing, and understanding new technologies. We work with these sources to ensure that our content is accurate and presented in its proper context.\nIn almost all cases, we properly and clearly identify our sources. Only in rare circumstances do we attribute information to unnamed sources, and only when there is a legitimate reason, such as protecting the safety of the source. Writers tell their editors the true identity of unnamed sources, except in extraordinary cases. We clearly explain to our readers why we are using an unnamed source.\nIn reporting stories with unattributed quotations, we would tell the unnamed sources that they were speaking to us “not for attribution.” If we tell sources they are speaking “off the record,” we mean that nothing we hear will be quoted, even without attribution. We always introduce ourselves as writers or editors for MIT Technology Review. Under no circumstances would we misrepresent ourselves in order to gain information.\nb. Accuracy and balance. It is the responsibility of all our editors and writers to be accurate and honest. We rely on our professional experience, judgment, and knowledge, guided by our responsibility to help our readers understand a subject. We don't reflexively give equal weight to all sides of a discussion. In matters of controversy, we will report the arguments of both sides fairly; but our ethical obligation is not to please any interest or party to a debate, but to bear witness to the truth if we know it, or to delineate the terms of the controversy if the truth of the matter is genuinely in doubt.\nc. Fact-checking and editing. MIT Technology Review's features, reviews, and some infographic stories enjoy the thorough fact-checking and multiple edits traditional to magazine journalism. Directories, charts, graphs, and similar data-rich elements are also fact-checked. News, news-analysis, opinions, and shorter stories receive abbreviated fact-checking and editing. Our events cannot, practically, be fact-checked, although we invite only authoritative, responsible speakers.\nTo preserve our independence, MIT Technology Review maintains strict rules guiding our professional conduct.\na. Gifts. Employees may not accept gifts of any kind, including samples from companies or products handed out at conferences and trade shows.\nWe solicit and receive electronic products to review; all such products are returned soon after the review is completed. Books, records, music, and software are treated like press releases. They can be kept by the person who reviews them or given away; they cannot be sold for personal profit. Any product reviews reflect our honest opinion of the product and are not affected by the willingness of the company to supply us with samples.\nWe are sometimes invited to conferences that are closed to the general public; on occasion, the invitations waive or discount the attendance fee as a press privilege. We go to such events and accept the discount when we think we will learn something useful to our audiences.\nb. Reimbursements. Our writers, editors, and freelancers do not accept reimbursement for travel or other expenses from the companies we cover, or from public-relations firms or regional development agencies. If a writer, editor, or freelancer flies on a private or corporate plane, or accepts other, similarly funded travel, we repay our hosts the cost of the trip.\nc. Freelancing. Employees are forbidden to do any freelance work that violates our independence, including providing consulting services to any companies that we cover. They may accept fees for speeches, but they cannot speak for pay to the companies we regularly cover. We ask freelance writers to divulge their business interests and do not knowingly hire writers with connections to the companies about which they write.\nd. Investments. MIT Technology Review's editors, writers, or freelancers cannot directly own individual stocks or equities in companies we cover, nor may they sell such shares short. If the spouse or partner of an editor, writer, or freelancer owned significant stock or equity in a company we cover, we would disclose the investment in a transparent way.\nMIT Technology Review follows the accepted practice of the media industry, enforcing a strict separation of “church and state” (editorial and advertisement). In accepting digital advertising, we follow the standards and guidelines of the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB). With print advertising, we are guided by the standards of ASME and the Magazine Publishers of America (MPA). At our events, we are careful to distinguish between our own programming and that of our sponsors.\na. Influence. This means that our advertising-sales and business development staff do not attempt to influence editorial coverage and do not suggest to potential advertisers or their agencies that coverage can be purchased. As a business, we do consider whether the broad topics of special issues and reports will be attractive to advertisers or their agencies. The editor in chief, editor, executive editor, and senior editors may speak or meet with potential advertisers or their agencies, but only to better explain the editorial mission of MIT Technology Review, and will at all times avoid creating the perception that editorial can be influenced by any business arrangements.\nb. Transparency. Our publishing platforms, whether digital or print, have been designed to avoid confusion between editorial and advertising. Where there is ambiguity, anything sponsored or otherwise purchased in MIT Technology Review's media is labeled “advertisement” or “sponsored.” Ads are positioned to avoid any misperception that they are endorsed by editorial. At our events, displays and speeches by sponsors are clearly and unambiguously described as purchased.\nMIT Technology Review sometimes publishes articles from sponsors in the same channels where our own editorial stories can be found—including the pages of our U.S. and international print magazines, the website’s home page, topic pages, story-level pages, and e-mail newsletters.\nMaterial from advertisers is always unambiguously labeled, and the sponsor is always clearly identified. This advertising material is produced without the involvement of MIT Technology Review’s editorial staff; sponsors either hire MIT Technology Review’s advertising team to create it on their behalf or produce it themselves. The subject matter and relevance of the pieces is approved by the magazine’s publisher. The publisher will reject sponsored content as inappropriate if it is not informative for our readers or is not aligned with the mission of this publication, which is to discuss the impact of new technologies. However, this does not mean that sponsored content reflects the views of MIT or MIT Technology Review’s editors; nor should the presence of sponsored content be taken as an endorsement of an advertiser’s products or services.\nSponsors have no influence on editorial decisions, including what we choose to write about. Editorial coverage of any of our advertisers may be flattering or unflattering, as a story warrants.\nMIT Technology Review licenses its editorial and brand to independent media companies around the world. We work with companies that share our ethics and standards, although, inevitably, journalism practices and media industry norms vary from region to region.\nMIT Technology Review is a 501(c)(3), not-for-profit media company, wholly owned by MIT but editorially independent from it. Several members of our board of directors, including its chair, are senior officers of MIT. Our board provides financial oversight and corporate governance, and also offers strategic advice to the company's chief executive and senior staff. The complete list of the board can be found here.\nMIT Technology Review is governed by the same integrity and commitment to excellence as other departments, labs, and centers at MIT. We benefit from the Institute's many resources, including easy access to its prominent faculty and researchers. At the same time, our coverage of technology is independent of MIT. We do not favor people or technologies simply because they are associated with the Institute. We are not part of MIT's communications functions; it is not our job to promote its activities.\nThe exception to this last rule is MIT News, a supplement to MIT Technology Review: it is paid for by the alumni association and distributed to all the Institute's alumni and most of its students and faculty. Some of the stories in MIT News are written by reporters from the Institute's News Office, although the section's editor is a MIT Technology Review employee."], 'https://www.technologyreview.com/help#contact-us': ['Support — How can we help?', 'MIT Alumni\nMIT Alumni specific questions\nDigital Subscription\nWeb access\nWeb troubleshooting\nDigital+Print\nAccount Management\nReset your password\nChange email address\nActivate your account\nMagazine Delivery\nReceive first issue\nChange mailing address\nDelivery troubleshooting\nOr, you can contact us directly with your question.\n\nI\'m a subscriber.

The system controls more than $6tn of federal cash flow each year, with millions of Americans depending on it for social security and medicare benefits, federal salaries, and more.\nUntil now, the information stored on it has been exceptionally closely guarded, with only a select few officials having clearance to control it. But since the advent of the Trump administration on 20 January, members of Musk’s Doge team have been battering to be given access.\nOn Friday, the Washington Post revealed that the Treasury Department’s top civil servant had retired after more than 30 years of service. David Lebryk had clashed with Musk associates over their efforts to effectively break into the system.\nAccording to the New York Times, Lebryk had been placed on administrative leave after he objected to Doge agents being given access. The newspaper reported that the incoming treasury secretary, Bessent, gave his permission to the new deal late on Friday.\nUnder the arrangement, the Times reported, one of the Doge members who can now scour the data of millions of Americans is Tom Krause, chief executive of the tech company Cloud Software Group.\nBefore confirming the deal, Wyden had already sounded the alarm about Musk’s attempts to break into such a sensitive federal database. On Friday he wrote to Bessent warning that the system was so critical “it simply cannot fail”.\nWyden warned that “any politically-motivated meddling in them risks severe damage to our country and the economy. I can think of no good reason why political operators who have demonstrated a blatant disregard for the law would need access to these sensitive, mission-critical systems.”\nOne of the fears about granting entry to the system to a freewheeling outfit controlled by Musk is that he could use it to block payments to a large number of federal programs as part of his mission to slash and burn the US government. Wyden also suggested that the move could pose a national security threat, given Musk’s extensive business interests in China, which in turn could give the Chinese intelligence services a pipeline into US data.\nThis “endangers US cybersecurity and creates conflicts of interest that make [Musk’s] access to these systems a national security risk,” Wyden said.'], 'https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign': ['Art & design', ''], 'https://www.theguardian.com/money': ['Money', ''], 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/feb/01/its-incredible-the-place-just-swarms-with-birdlife-inside-englands-biggest-bird-sanctuary': ['‘It’s incredible, the place just swarms with birdlife’: inside England’s biggest bird sanctuary', "The reserve in Geltsdale in the north Pennines has been expanded by a third after RSPB buys land\nIt covers more than 50 square kilometres of blanket bog, heath, meadows and woodland and rises from a valley floor to the 640m summit of Cold Fell in the north Pennines. This is RSPB Geltsdale, and it will now be the organisation’s largest English bird sanctuary when the society announces this week that it has bought land that expands the existing reserve by a third.\n“This is going to be a reserve on a different scale from many of our other sites in England,” said Beccy Speight, the RSPB’s chief executive.\n“We are going to achieve an abundance of species and a size that will be unmatched for bird reserves elsewhere. It is going to demonstrate what is possible when it comes to rewilding and protecting birds.”\nGeltsdale is already home to birds that range from curlews to golden plovers and from merlins to ring ouzels. It is also one of the few places where hen harriers nest in England. Last year, hen harriers – one of Britain’s most persecuted raptors - produced eight chicks at Geltsdale.\nElsewhere, the bird – sometimes known as the ghost of the moor – has been pushed close to extinction because of illegal killing and nest disturbance.\nOther birds that proliferate at Geltsdale include short-eared owls, black grouse, lapwing, redshank and snipe, and it is hoped that the reserve will soon attract a host of new species, including golden eagles.\nThe RSPB’s already sizeable reserve at Geltsdale will now be expanded to cover 5,500 hectares (13,590 acres) thanks to the purchase of the new chunk of land for an undisclosed sum. “We started working here in the 1970s and ended up owning roughly two-thirds of the site, while we leased the other third,” said Dave Morris, the RSPB’s area operations manager for Cumbria and Northeast England.\n“Now we have purchased that last third and own all of Geltsdale, which will allow us to create a reserve that stretches from the valley floor to the top of Cold Fell, and which will be inhabited by birds that thrive in so many different habitats.”\nAt the lowest levels, dippers and wildfowl – even osprey – are now making appearances. Then, further up the hillside, black grouse, nightjar and whinchat are becoming common. Nearer the top, on the open moorland, ring ouzels and hen harriers can be seen.\nThe reserve’s recently augmented size means that it is now only beaten, in terms of area of land covered, by two other RSPB sites: Forsinard Flows and Loch Garten, Abernethy, both in the Highlands.\n“Geltsdale is now the biggest in England,” said Speight. “And that size makes such a difference. When you walk through the reserve during breeding season, it is incredible. The place just swarms with birdlife.”\nCrucially, the reserve includes a working farm, and much of the future rewilding work that will be carried out to create the multimillion pound restoration project that is planned for Geltsdale will involve developing ways for agriculture and nature to work together, added Morris. “That has to be a key goal,” he added.\nAn example of the problems to be tackled is the issue of cattle grazing. “Cattle have traditionally been fenced in,” said Morris. “However, birds like black grouse will crash into these fences and kill themselves.\nSign up to Observed\nAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers\nafter newsletter promotion\n“So we have turned to technology for a solution: a system of invisible fencing is going to be installed.”\nThis odd-sounding technique involves fitting cows and calves with collar receivers that can pick up GPS signals, which are then used to create virtual grazing areas for the animals. If one approaches the edge of its delineated area, its receiver detects the boundary and starts to emit a sound that rises in pitch or eventually delivers a mild electric pulse as the animal tries to cross the boundary. In this way, the animals are contained within a fixed area of land without the need to erect fences.\n“That’s how farmers will manage cattle in that landscape. It will allow them to move these unfenced areas and effectively emulate naturalistic grazing by wild, large herbivores,” said Morris.\nIn addition to invisible fencing, the practice of heather burning has been halted. This was carried out on the old grouse shooting estates of Geltsdale in order to encourage new shoots to grow and provide food for the grouse. However, this practice released the carbon dioxide stored in the peatland below and has been stopped.\nSimilarly, moorland drains have been removed, which will let sphagnum moss – the building block of peat – to recover, a move that also helps to restore the area’s ability to store carbon dioxide and limit the rate at which the gas helps to heat the atmosphere.\nIt is also planned to continue with work to restore streams whose courses have been channelled so that they follow more meandering courses, retaining water for longer periods so that fish can spawn more easily. This in turn will attract avian predators such as osprey.\n“I think Geltsdale is a real symbol of hope because it shows what the uplands could be like in terms of the abundance of birds and other species,” said Speight. “When you are in it, you get a real feeling of space, and a sense of how the uplands could be.”"], 'https://support.theguardian.com/subscribe/weekly?REFPVID=undefined&INTCMP=undefined&acquisitionData=%7B%22source%22%3A%22GUARDIAN_WEB%22%2C%22componentId%22%3A%22PrintSubscriptionsHeaderLink%22%2C%22componentType%22%3A%22ACQUISITIONS_HEADER%22%2C%22referrerUrl%22%3A%22%22%7D': 'Error: Could not find an article title', 'https://www.theguardian.com/info/privacy': ['Privacy', ''], 'https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour': ['Labour', ''], 'https://www.theguardian.com/sport/tennis': ['Tennis', ''], 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jan/31/rat-numbers-cities-climate-temperatures-rodents': ['‘Perfect rat storm’: urban rodent numbers soar as the climate heats, study finds', 'Sharp rise in population in 11 of 16 cities expected to continue as rising temperatures make it easier for the animals to breed, say researchers\nRat numbers are soaring in cities as global temperatures warm, research shows.\nWashington DC, San Francisco, Toronto, New York City and Amsterdam had the greatest increase in these rodents, according to the study, which looked at data from 16 cities globally. Eleven of the cities showed “significant increasing trends in rat numbers”, said the paper published in the journal Science Advances, and these trends were likely to continue.\nOver the past decade, rats increased by 390% in Washington DC, 300% in San Francisco, 186% in Toronto and 162% in New York according to researchers, who analysed public sightings and infestation reports.\nSome big cities, such as London and Paris, were not included because they did not provide the necessary data – but researchers said the findings would apply to many similar cities around the world. “There’d be no reason to expect it to be different in other places,” said lead researcher Jonathan Richardson, from the University of Richmond in Virginia.\nIn Toronto, one of the worst-affected locations, a “perfect rat storm” has taken hold, with residents of Canada’s biggest city staring down a surging population.\n“When you walk the streets of Toronto, under your feet, deep in the sewage system, is a place teeming with rats,” said Alice Sinia, lead entomologist for Orkin, the country’s largest pest control company. “Increasingly we’re flushing them out into open spaces – either through construction or floods – and they have to go somewhere.”\nToronto city’s helpline fielded 1,600 rat-related calls in 2023, up from 940 in 2019 and Orkin has also experienced a surge in calls.\n“But the reality is, we don’t know how big the population is because no one has ever really studied it formally,” said Sinia.\nTwo Toronto city councillors, Alejandra Bravo and Amber Morley, last year called for a formal management plan as a way to blunt the crisis.\n“It’s a really critical quality-of-life problem when people have all of a sudden been confronted with rats coming into their home or into their business or their place of work,” Bravo told the Canadian press, adding that it had morphed into a “kind of perfect rat storm”.\nOther cities with increasing rat populations included Oakland, Buffalo, Chicago, Boston, Kansas City and Cincinnati. The research focused on US cities, as well as Amsterdam, Toronto and Tokyo, as all of them gathered similar data on rat sightings. The research did not quantify the overall rat population, just relative increases in reports over time.\nRising temperatures correlated with rising rat numbers, researchers wrote in the paper. As small mammals, rats struggle during winter, but in higher temperatures they can breed for more of the year and forage for longer.\nIn Toronto, cold winters had long acted as “mother nature’s pest control”, said Sinia, killing off swaths of the population. But mild temperatures had helped rodents of all kinds in the city to keep breeding.\nThe fact that rat numbers increased fastest in cities that were warming fastest was “the gloomiest outcome of the study”, said Richardson. Last year was the hottest on record, with average temperatures 1.6C above preindustrial levels.\nRats cause billions of dollars in damage by infiltrating buildings each year, and can transmit at least 60 diseases to humans, as well as affecting the ecology of other species living in cities. In regions where they are an invasive species, they do huge damage to biodiversity. Research suggests people who encounter rats frequently have poorer mental health. Globally, humanity’s “war on rats” costs an estimated $500m each year, according to the study.\nTokyo, Louisville and New Orleans bucked the trend with declining rat numbers. In Tokyo, Richardson speculated that cultural norms and expectations of cleanliness meant people were quick to report rodent sightings. In New Orleans there has been educational outreach on how to prevent infestations. “There are important lessons probably to be gleaned from those cities,” said Richardson.\nResearchers say the best pest management strategies involve making the urban environment less rat-friendly – for example by putting rubbish in containers, and not in bags on the street – rather than removing rodents that are already there.\nDespite thousands of studies on lab rats, little was known about wild urban rats, said Richardson. “We need to know the battle that we’re fighting. Pretty much every city announces that they have a war on rats.”\nSometimes there can be up to 100 rats in a single colony, which usually occupies less than one block. “I do not like rats,” he said, “but there is something fascinating about an organism that has been able to spread over the world and live in such proximity to us so successfully.”'], 'https://www.theguardian.com/weekly?INTCMP=gdnwb_mawns_editorial_gweekly_GW_TopNav_Int': 'Error: Could not find an article body', 'https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian': 'Error: Could not find an article body', 'https://www.theguardian.com/preference/edition/uk': ['Headlines', "Sign up for The Overwhelm\nGuardian writers share their experiences of overwhelm and how to avoid it, straight to your inbox every week\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The tariffs against Canada tax oil and energy products at 10%.\nTrump said on his own Truth Social social media platform that he had used emergency powers to issue the tariffs, due to come into effect on Tuesday, “because of the major threat of illegal aliens and deadly drugs killing our Citizens, including fentanyl”.\nThe Journal said the moves “reminds us of the old Bernard Lewis joke that it’s risky to be America’s enemy but it can be fatal to be its friend”, adding that with the exception of China “Mr Trump’s justification for this economic assault on the neighbors makes no sense.”\nIt added: “Drugs may be an excuse since Mr Trump has made clear he likes tariffs for their own sake, pointing to Trump’s comments on Thursday that the US doesn’t need oil or lumber from its neighbors.\n“Mr Trump sometimes sounds as if the US shouldn’t import anything at all, that America can be a perfectly closed economy making everything at home,” the editorial continued. “This is called autarky, and it isn’t the world we live in, or one that we should want to live in, as Mr Trump may soon find out.”\nTrump reacted strongly to the outlet’s editorial position, posting on Truth Social that “a ‘Tariff Lobby’, headed by the Globalist, and always wrong, Wall Street Journal, is working hard to justify Countries like Canada, Mexico, China, and too many others to name, continue the decades long RIPOFF OF AMERICA, both with regard to TRADE, CRIME, AND POISONOUS DRUGS that are allowed to so freely flow into AMERICA.\n“THOSE DAYS ARE OVER!”, Trump continues in the screed. “The USA has major deficits with Canada, Mexico, and China (and almost all countries!), owes 36 Trillion Dollars, and we’re not going to be the “Stupid Country” any longer.”\nLarry Summers, treasury secretary under Bill Clinton, called the impending tariffs “a self-inflicted supply shock.“It means less supply because we’re taxing foreign suppliers. And that will mean higher prices and lower quantities,” Summers told CNN. “This is a self-inflicted wound to the American economy. I’d expect inflation over the next three or four months to be higher as a consequence, because the price level has to go up when you put a levy on goods that people are buying.”\nKirsten Hillman, Canada’s ambassador to the US, told ABC’s This Week that Trump’s tariff move “is disrupting to an incredibly successful trading relationship.\n“We’re really disappointed and we’re hopeful that they don’t come into effect on Tuesday,” Hillman added. “We’re ready to continue to talk to the Trump administration about that.”\nHillman said Canada was eager to build on its trading relationship with the US but acknowledged “it’s hard to maintain that sense of common purpose and moving forward if we get into this kind of a dynamic on tariffs”.\nThe Mexican president, Claudia Sheinbaum, ordered retaliatory tariffs in response to the US decision to slap tariffs on all goods coming from Mexico, saying her government sought dialogue rather than confrontation with its trade partner to the north.\nSheinbaum pointed to her government’s action against fentanyl production in Mexico since she took office in October, saying it had seized 20m doses of the synthetic opioid and detained 10,000 individuals tied to drug trafficking.\nMexico has ordered retaliatory tariffs and Canada’s prime minister said the country would put matching 25% tariffs on up to $155bn in US imports. China’s Ministry of Commerce said it would file a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization for the “wrongful practices of the US”.\nBut some US business leaders have reacted neutrally to Trump’s tariffs that the Budget Lab at Yale University estimates would cost the average American household $1,000 to $1,200 in annual purchasing power.\nGregory Daco, chief economist at the tax and consulting firm EY, calculates the tariffs would increase inflation, currently running at 2.9%, by 0.4% and cut US GDP by 1.5% this year.\nJamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan, the world’s largest bank, said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week that tariff threats can be used effectively to “bring people to the table” to negotiate more favorable trade terms.\nTariffs are “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon”, depending on how they’re used, Dimon remarked to CNBC. “I would put in perspective: if it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it. I mean, get over it.”\nWilliam Reinsch, a former US trade official now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said many companies had stocked up on imported goods ahead of time to avoid the tariffs and would be able to draw on existing inventories.\nThat may be an effective strategy for non-perishable goods, like construction materials, but less so for perishable goods that are not afforded the ability to stockpile. “You don’t stockpile avocados,’’ Reinsch said. “You don’t stockpile cut flowers. You don’t stockpile bananas.’’\nThe US Chamber of Commerce business group warned that the tariff policy was wrong-headed and would cause economic harm to Americans.\nThe group’s senior vice-president John Murphy said: “The President is right to focus on major problems like our broken border and the scourge of fentanyl, but the imposition of tariffs under IEEPA is unprecedented, won’t solve these problems, and will only raise prices for American families and upend supply chains.”\nHe added: “The Chamber will consult with our members, including main street businesses across the country impacted by this move, to determine next steps to prevent economic harm to Americans.”\nDemocratic politicians were not impressed. “Donald Trump got hired … saying he was going to lower grocery prices. Two weeks in, he’s doing something that’s going to do the opposite,” senator Mark Warner told CBS’s Face the Nation.\nThe Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar summed up her thoughts on the early days on the second Trump administration on MSNBC: “Chaos up, corruption up, and, sadly, prices of eggs up … This is not what American economy needs right now … He is not using a chisel, he is using a sledgehammer.”\nThis story was amended on 2 February 2025 to clarify that Canada’s oil and energy products would be under a 10% tariff.'], 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jan/31/keir-starmer-warned-against-approving-rosebank-oilfield-labour-unease-heathrow': ['‘We’d go absolutely nuts’: PM warned of Labour fight if he backs huge oilfield', 'Exclusive: MPs and ministers say they would oppose Starmer if he tries to approve Rosebank development\nSenior Labour figures are warning of a serious fight if Keir Starmer tries to give the go-ahead to a giant new oilfield off Shetland later this year.\nMPs and ministers have told the Guardian they are prepared to oppose the UK prime minister should he try and give final consent to the Rosebank development, which is Britain’s biggest untapped oilfield.\nMany in the party see the battle over Rosebank as the next front in the struggle between its environmental wing and those around Rachel Reeves who want to push for economic growth above all else. The chancellor signalled her support for a third runway at Heathrow this week as part of the government’s latest push to stimulate the economy.\nOne ally of the energy secretary, Ed Miliband, who is leading the government’s climate agenda, said the former Labour leader would have a “punchy” response for any attempt to give consent to Rosebank. The ally said: “Ed will come to that fight armed with a lot of evidence about what Rosebank will do to our carbon emissions.”\nA spokesperson for Miliband declined to comment.\nA Labour backbencher said: “[A decision around Rosebank] will be a moment to speak out. There are a lot of us, on every wing of the party, who would go absolutely nuts if that happened.”\nAnother Labour MP said: “Not many in the party are going to man the barricades over Heathrow, but Rosebank is a very different matter altogether. There would be massive resistance if they try and give consent for that.”\nThe Rosebank development lost a significant court case this week when a judge in Scotland ruled the decision by the previous government to give it the green light had been unlawful. The judge ruled that ministers should not have given it consent without knowing how much carbon dioxide would be generated by burning the oil the field will produce over its lifetime.\nEquinor, the Norwegian energy company that is leading the Rosebank project, is expected to carry out that more detailed assessment and come back with a renewed consent application later this year. An Equinor spokesperson said after the ruling it would continue to work with the government on securing consent, adding: “Rosebank is critical for the UK’s economic growth.”\nBut while the decision is technically up to the independent North Sea Transition Authority, government officials say it is likely to be so sensitive that the prime minister himself will have to weigh in.\nLabour came into government last year promising not to issue any new licences for oil and gas fields in the North Sea. The Rosebank project, however, already has its licence and can continue developing the field until it gets environmental consent to start pumping oil out of the ground.\nA source close to Starmer said the prime minister had not ruled out giving the go-ahead for the field but would want to see the application first.\nMany, however, think it has been made more likely by the government’s renewed push for growth, after Reeves signalled her approval for another runway at Heathrow as well as further liberalisation of the planning regime.\nAsked last week about the clash between her economic agenda and the government’s environmental targets, Reeves said: “Growth is the number-one mission of this government, because growth underpins everything else, whether that is improving our schools and our hospitals, or indeed being able to get to net zero.”\nOne oil and gas lobbyist said: “Three months ago I would have been less confident that the government would give consent. But Trump and Labour’s post-Christmas growth zeal makes it significantly more likely.” Equinor said the project would generate jobs for 4,000 people.\nReeves’s apparent downgrading of the government’s climate mission is already causing unease in Labour circles. The backbencher Clive Lewis wrote in the Guardian on Friday: “A growing suspicion looms that our government lacks a coherent governing philosophy or ideological compass beyond the vague pursuit of ‘growth’. But if growth at any cost is the mantra, the costs will soon become painfully clear.”\nSign up to First Edition\nOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters\nafter newsletter promotion\nMiliband is understood to have advised cabinet this week that any plan to expand Heathrow would probably violate the country’s carbon emissions targets, although he has said he will not resign over the issue.\nMany Labour backbenchers say they have been willing to swallow their concerns about Heathrow on the basis that the project is unlikely to go ahead. But some say they are looking out for any further sign of the government walking away from its green agenda.\nOne Labour MP told the Guardian: “We are proud that we’re the most green government the country has ever had. That’s important, and not something you’d want to lose.”\nAnother said: “Once Justin Trudeau is out [as Canadian prime minister], Keir will essentially be the world leader who is the most prominently committed to climate. I think we should not shy away from taking on that mantle.”\nMiliband is preparing to publish the results of a recent consultation with the energy industry and the public more generally about how the government should account for the emissions from oil and gas produced in the UK.\nGovernment officials say the outcome of that consultation will be vital in deciding whether or not they can give consent to a new oilfield while also remaining within Labour’s CO2 reduction commitments.\nCampaigners argue that the project is unlikely to produce the growth promised by its backers.\nTessa Khan, the executive director of Uplift, said: “Renewables are the key growth sector of the UK, both in terms of investment and jobs, and where our global advantage lies.\n“But that sector is now in competition with the oil and gas industry for workers, supply chains, port space and other resources, not to mention the disastrous signals doubling down on oil and gas sends to clean-energy investors.”'], 'https://www.theguardian.com/tone/recipes': ['find something to cook', '2025 has arrived, so why not start the new year discovering new flavours?

It has killed off at least 90 species and affected hundreds more. Darwin’s frogs, named after the Victorian naturalist who discovered them in 1834, are highly susceptible to the disease and die within weeks of becoming infected.\nOn a five-day expedition to the park in October last year, the rescue team collected 55 Darwin’s frogs. Some were located after local guides mimicked the amphibians’ calls, prompting responses from the tiny creatures.\nShortly after capturing the frogs, which weigh only 2g fully grown, the team realised that 11 males were carrying young. Darwin’s frogs have an unusual reproductive cycle. The males fertilise eggs that females lay on the forest floor and two to three weeks they later collect them in their mouths where they pass into a vocal sac for brooding. The tadpoles slowly metamorphose and are later born as froglets.\nTo check whether the frogs were infected with fungus, skin swabs were sent to a laboratory in Chile’s capital, Santiago. Tests identified two contaminated frogs. The remaining 53 were cleared for the approximately 8,000-mile (13,000km) journey to London by boat, plane and van.\nThe frogs arrived in good health and were transferred to a newly built biosecure room at the zoo that mimics the cool temperature, rainfall, lighting and foliage of the frogs’ natural habitat. Once settled, the males that had been carrying tadpoles on capture released 33 froglets into the enclosure. Each measured about 5mm long.\n“We have the founders, the first adults, and now we have this first generation of offspring born at the zoo,” Valenzuela-Sánchez told the Guardian. The researchers now hope to breed the frogs and study potential treatments for chytrid fungus that would allow the amphibians to be returned home.\nThe rescue mission was recorded for ZSL by the wildlife film-maker Paul Glynn, whose documentary A Leap of Hope will premiere on YouTube at 6pm GMT on Monday.'], 'https://www.theguardian.com/technology': ['Technology', ''], 'https://www.theguardian.com/video': ['News', ''], 'https://www.theguardian.com/stage': ['Stage', ''], 'https://www.theguardian.com/info/cookies': ['Cookie policy', 'This is the cookie policy for Guardian News & Media Limited (collectively referred to as “Guardian”, “we”, “us” or “our” in this policy), our sites such as theguardian.com, and our associated apps (“our sites”).

And the flood waters were still rising, with rain set to continue.\nWith reports of up to one metre of rainfall in parts of north-east Queensland, the heaviest rain has fallen between Lucinda to Townsville in northern Queensland as the Bureau of Meteorology warns the big wet will continue for days.\nIngham and nearby towns, about 100km from Townsville, are some of the worst hit areas, with residents experiencing flooding from the Herbert River.\nThe continued deluge has led to swollen waterways with major flood warnings in place for the Herbert River, the Ross and Bohle River, the Horton River and the Upper Burdekin River.\nWith more heavy rain forecast for the next 24 hours, the Herbert is likely to break the 1967 record of 15.2 metres.\nQueensland’s premier, David Crisafulli – who grew up on his family’s sugar cane farm in Ingham – has said the floods will be a “once-in-a-century” event for the town. Authorities say the town has lost power and an extended outage is likely.\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email\nThe atmospheric factors behind these floods are similar to previous floods in the region – and climate change is no doubt playing a role.\nFor many people in Townsville – the largest city in northern Australia – the unfolding emergency will bring back memories of the devastating February 2019 floods, which caused $1.24bn in damage. Residents have been asked to evacuate from several low-lying suburbs which were inundated in 2019.\nIt is too early to say if this flood will be worse. Fortunately, water levels in the city’s Ross River Dam are much lower than 2019. Townsville airport recorded 545mm of rain over the 48 hours to Sunday morning, with many north-west suburbs recording much higher levels. The township of Rollingstone – 60km north-west of Townsville – recorded a whopping 702mm over the 24 hours to 9am Sunday.\nFurther north in the Cairns to Daintree region, residents are watching with concern, with many still raw after the record-breaking floods of December 2023.\nThe 2025 extreme rainfall event, the 2019 Townsville floods and the 2023 Cairns and Daintree floods are remarkably similar in many ways.\nWhat triggered each of these floods was prolonged heavy rain falling on the south-east flank of a stationary tropical low weather system. Normally, tropical lows bring wind and rain but move through quite quickly. But now some of these systems are stalling, sitting in place over or near land and dumping huge volumes of rain.\nLast week the Bureau of Meteorology warned that five tropical lows were forming around northern Australia. Most tropical cyclones form from tropical lows embedded in the region’s monsoon trough, a large low pressure band which forms over summer and draws in warm, moist air from the adjacent tropical seas.\nBut significant rain events like this one don’t necessarily require a tropical cyclone. Slow-moving deep monsoon lows over land can also deliver huge amounts of rain and widespread flooding.\nThese atmospheric conditions allow intense rain bands to form between converging winds: warm, moist winds from the north-east and south-east winds originating from the Coral Sea. As the winds collide, they push the moist air up into the cooler parts of the atmosphere where it condenses and falls as torrential rain.\nMore extreme rainfall and higher frequencies of flooded rivers and flash floods around the world have a clear link to climate change and global heating.\nThe main drivers behind these events include warming of the atmosphere. For every 1C of warming, the atmosphere holds 7% more water vapour. Research suggests this figure could be even higher for short-duration rainfall.\nHotter oceans hold more energy, meaning they can also amplify the global water cycle.\nThis year sea surface temperatures in the north-west Coral Sea are 1C to 2C above average. Ocean temperatures have risen because of a lack of cloud cover and rain last month. In north-western Australia, this has given rise to an intensifying marine heatwave.\nThis ocean heat is likely to be driven by the Australian monsoon’s latest recorded arrival. The monsoon brings heavy rains to northern Australia, triggering the wet season. When it arrives, sea surface temperatures generally drop due to a combination of high cloud cover and the cooling effect of rainwater.\nAfter a slow start, the north Australian monsoon season is now in full swing.\nThe Bureau of Meteorology is monitoring an active monsoon trough for any low-pressure systems, which may develop into tropical cyclones over the next week or so. If a cyclone does form, it will gain energy from warmer than usual sea surface temperatures.\nThe flood emergency in north Queensland is far from over. All global circulation models predict that heavy rain will continue in the region, extending up towards Cape York and the gulf country as a monsoon surge moves in from Indonesia.\nAs river catchments get saturated, more and more water will run off and engorge rivers. Forecasts are for rain to continue for the next few days. We are likely to see more flooding in more places this week.\nFor the latest updates, check the Bureau of Meteorology’s Queensland flood warnings, ABC Emergency or local ABC radio stations.\nThis article originally appeared in the Conversation.

I felt very welcome immediately. I feel this is sacred land.” The idea of uprooting the community feels like a violent act to Cooke: “You don’t just move an oak tree. It won’t work.”\nMembers of the community claim there are elements of “colonialism” in what is happening. Cooke, who used to work for Extinction Rebellion UK, said: “She is coming here and using power she has because of the money she has.”\nThe members have been told that their tenancy rights ended on 31 December. On 17 January the new owner’s lawyer gave them seven days to move out – or proceedings for possession would be issued.\nSome have left, including all the children, but six adults and three long-term volunteers remain and on 8 February will hold a “We’re still here” gathering, a rallying cry borrowed from the defiant Welsh folk song Yma o Hyd.\nNick Ward has lived at Brithdir Mawr for a decade and his two children grew up here. “It was an amazing place to bring them up,” he said. “They had freedom and thrived. What is happening makes us all very sad.”\nThe community has written to May arguing the legal process is not the way to go, that people need to learn to live on the land together. They emphasise that they do not blame her but believe their plight is the result of a broken system.\nBrithdir Mawr (which could be translated as “large patchwork”, apparently a reference to the mix of soils and landscapes on the farm) was discreetly founded in 1994 and made headlines around the world in 1998 after it was spotted by a survey plane, leading to the residents being described in the press as a “lost tribe”. Their aim, they say, is to “encourage and allow to emerge a nourishing, mature and eco-centric human culture that fosters connection at every level: connection to each other, our human tribe, the land, the earth, those beings other-than-human, our own inner worlds, and the individual purposes and gifts that we bring to the world”.\nBut they are not elusive or inward-looking and have taken in volunteer workers over the years and put on courses, including in Celtic languages and self-sufficiency.\nMany have had jobs in nearby towns and villages and they have also been at the centre of the Welsh one planet development policy, which makes it easier to build eco homes and communities.\nThe landlord, who was one of the original founders but moved away, decided to sell some years ago. Members of the co-operative raised £800,000 to try to buy the land but it was sold to May, a teacher, doula and shadow work coach for a sum the community believe was about £1m.\nShe told the Guardian she wanted to renovate the buildings, which include a fine old farmhouse, and create an “affordable healing retreat centre connected to Carningli (Angel mountain), which soars above the site.\nMay said she had explored possibilities of working with the current members. “I told them I was willing to negotiate but that required a clean slate with the existing tenancy rights having to end. They were not interested in the new vision and the negotiations came to nothing. I felt this left me little alternative but to pursue eviction.”\nShe rejects the accusations of colonialism, saying that she has a long-standing connection to west Wales and has sold her family home to invest. “I am not a corporate landlord. Some of the community members cannot or will not admit that I own the land. They refuse to face the facts.”\nEmma Orbach, another Brithdir Mawr founder, who now lives on land next door, described the situation as “deeply distressing” but backed May and said they would work together. “It’s not just about land and getting things from it; it’s about our spiritual connection to the land,” she said.\nFor now, the Brithdir Mawr members are trying to get on with their usual routine.\nAnne was full of smiles as she tended to the eight British Toggenburgs nanny goats and one visiting male – Billy Fury – but became tearful when asked how she felt. “I’m heartbroken, that’s the truth,” she said.\nRosie Gillam, who grew up nearby and first came aged eight to learn circus skills, paused in her wood chopping, to give her opinion. “This is such a special spot. There needs to be more places like this, not fewer.”'], 'https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling': ['Cycling', ''], 'https://www.theguardian.com/inpictures': ['Featured galleries', ''], 'https://app.adjust.com/16xt6hai': 'Error: Could not find an article body', 'https://holidays.theguardian.com?INTCMP=holidays_int_web_newheader': 'Error: Could not find an article body', 'https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/picture/2025/jan/30/ben-jennings-labour-climate-climbdown-cartoon': ['Ben Jennings on Labour’s climate climbdown – cartoon', ''], 'https://advertising.theguardian.com': ['Guardian Advertising', ''], 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/feb/01/labour-warned-risks-losing-support-net-zero-costs-not-spread-fairly': ['Labour warned it risks losing support for net zero if costs not spread fairly', "Exclusive: Chief climate adviser calls on Starmer to make ‘strong, confident’ case for green UK that public can buy into\nEnsuring that the costs of decarbonisation are shared fairly across society must be a top priority for ministers or they risk losing public support for net zero, the UK’s chief climate adviser has warned.\nKeir Starmer and Rachel Reeves should be making a “strong, confident” case for decarbonisation as an engine of economic growth, according to Emma Pinchbeck, the chief executive of the Climate Change Committee, the independent statutory adviser.\nBut politicians of all parties had difficulty grasping the scale and speed of the shift to a low-carbon economy, despite the huge economic benefits it could bring, she said, while the public were often still in the dark over what net zero would involve.\n“I would absolutely love to see the government confidently championing this agenda,” she told the Guardian. “They can call it what they like, but it is important that they do it.”\nWhile cutting greenhouse gas emissions requires upfront investment, in renewable forms of power such as wind and solar, it delivers cost savings and greater efficiency in the longer term. “Decarbonisation is better for growth than not decarbonising,” said Pinchbeck. “That’s largely to do with the efficiency of using clean energy through the economy, rather than relying on fossil fuel imports. It’s just a very much more efficient energy system.”\nShe added: “There’s a very powerful economic argument here, and it always troubles me when I hear politicians polarise them [the issues of economic growth and moving to a low-carbon society]. Because they are essential to one another. You can’t have economic growth without delivering on net zero.”\nReeves was accused this week of ignoring environmental concerns in pursuit of growth at all costs, in greenlighting the expansion of Heathrow airport and streamlining the planning regime for other infrastructure. While the chancellor reaffirmed her commitment to the government’s net zero targets and placed green provisos on airport expansion, she made clear that growth was the top priority, which has raised concerns among some environmentalists.\nThe CCC will not oppose the chancellor’s plans – its job is to advise on how to meet the UK’s net zero targets, not prescribe policy. Its experts analyse the various means by which emissions could be cut, and where choices must be made. Airports can be expanded, the CCC has said previously, but the government must then seek equivalent carbon savings elsewhere.\nPinchbeck said: “In all areas of the economy, you either replace a fossil fuel with an alternative that’s low-carbon, or you have to reduce demand for that thing. Or you capture any residual emissions and store them. Aviation is one of those sectors where it’s probably a mix of all of the above.”\nPinchbeck was speaking before full details of the announcements had been disclosed and did not comment on Reeves’s speech afterwards, but she is likely to have more to say on all of the government’s growth plans soon. The CCC is putting the final touches to the UK’s next “carbon budget”, a blueprint that sets out what cuts must be made in greenhouse gas emissions over a five-year period in order to meet the long-term binding target of net zero emissions by 2050.\nThe UK is midway through the fourth carbon budget, which runs from 2023 to 2027, in a series stretching back to the Climate Change Act of 2008. On 26 February, the CCC will announce details of the seventh carbon budget, to run from 2038 to 2042, and which is expected to require some of the most drastic emissions cuts yet. Although it will begin long after this parliament ends, Labour will have to provide a response showing how it will prepare to meet the new targets, and have to show how its policies meet current commitments on emissions cuts this decade – on which the CCC has already warned the UK is badly off track.\n“The important thing for politicians in all parties to really understand is that there is this massive energy transition happening. It is so big and so fast,” Pinchbeck said. The changes would encompass policy across government, from energy security, geopolitics, industry, jobs and growth to fuel poverty and health. “There is a case for every politician to make on something that is in the carbon budget,” she added.\nThough the CCC does not write policy, it can set out the likely pros and cons of options for reaching the emissions targets, and in its forthcoming budget there will be analysis on some of the most contentious green policy areas this government must decide on: airport expansion; North Sea oil and gas; carbon capture and storage; the future of hydrogen energy and home heating; nuclear power; and whether to subsidise burning wood in power stations.\nPinchbeck, who took the helm at the CCC in November after nearly five years as chief executive of the Energy UK trade body, was tight-lipped on what exactly the report would contain, but was enthusiastic about one innovation: the new budget will examine fairness and the social impacts of net zero.\nSign up to Down to Earth\nThe planet's most important stories.

We’ve also run a citizens’ panel, where we’ve talked to people about some policy options, just to give government some qualitative information on alternative options for routes forward on some issues.”\nFairness was at the core of public concern, she said. “When you ask the British public, they are very mindful of fairness. The main issue on fairness is how you fund the capital cost of investment. No one should pretend there isn’t a cost to change a heating system, or buy a new vehicle, or build a new wind farm. We can see that the cost is paid back in operational savings, but you still have to, for many households, work out how they’re going to get the car in the first place. We’ve got to find solutions so that all households, particularly those that would most benefit, can get these technologies as soon as possible.”\nIn conversations about airport expansion, for instance, it is important to bear in mind that more than half of the public do not take flights in any given year. “So there’s a question about who bears the costs for aviation decarbonising and how you do that,” she said.\nBringing down electricity costs would also make a difference. “We would like to see the government taking action to make electricity cheap,” said Pinchbeck. “Cheap electricity helps everyone and everything.”\nOne way of doing that would be to take the green levies that help to fund renewable energy off bills and add them to general taxation. But while Reeves is concerned about tax levels, that is unlikely.\nThe CCC cannot require the government to take such a step, but Pinchbeck notes the unfair impact of the current system. Funding investment in renewables by adding the cost to energy bills “is more regressive than, for example, putting it in taxation”.\nTo a government facing economic headwinds and a barrage of criticism from right and left, the complexities of seeking low-carbon answers to the UK’s problems – across the key areas of transport, housing, the cost of living and industry – might seem a luxury to be dispensed with. But Pinchbeck is clear: failure to decarbonise now would not improve the economy, but saddle the UK with enormous costs in years to come. “We model the carbon budgets against the baseline where we do nothing,” she said. “And the baseline where we do nothing is worse for the economy, and worse for people, than doing something.”"], 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment': ['Environment', 'atmospheric CO2 in parts per million, \n21 July 2024\nabove safe level\nin past 10 years'], 'https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing': ['Health & fitness', ''], 'https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rachel-reeves': ['Rachel Reeves', ''], 'https://www.wordiply.com': 'Error: Could not find an article title', 'https://support.theguardian.com?INTCMP=side_menu_support&acquisitionData=%7B%22source%22:%22GUARDIAN_WEB%22,%22componentType%22:%22ACQUISITIONS_HEADER%22,%22componentId%22:%22side_menu_support%22%7D': 'Error: Could not find an article title', 'https://jobs.theguardian.com': 'Error: Could not fetch page: 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://jobs.theguardian.com/', 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/feb/01/reevess-heathrow-third-runway-report-was-commissioned-by-london-airport': ['Reeves’s Heathrow third runway report was commissioned by London airport', "The chancellor is under fire after a study cited as evidence for expanding the terminal to boost the UK’s economic growth was ordered by Heathrow itself\nRachel Reeves was facing criticism on Saturday night as it was confirmed that a report she cited as evidence that a third \xadrunway at Heathrow would boost the UK economy was commissioned by the airport itself.\nExperts and green groups also challenged Reeves’s view that advances in the production of \xadsustainable aviation fuel (SAF) had been a “gamechanger” that would substantially limit the environmental damage of flying, \xadsaying the claims were overblown and did not stand up to scrutiny.\nIn a speech in Oxford heralding her commitment to “leave no stone unturned” in the search for economic growth, the \xadchancellor said a new runway would create 100,000 new jobs and connect the UK “to emerging markets all over the world, opening up new opportunities for growth”.\nShe added: “According to the\xa0most recent study from Frontier Economics, a third runway could increase potential GDP by 0.43% by 2050”.\nIn addition, “60% of that boost would go to areas outside London and the south-east,” she said.\nThe Frontier Economics consultancy has since confirmed to the Observer that it had been commissioned by Heathrow to write the report, which it insisted had been an entirely independent exercise. Heathrow confirmed it had asked Frontier Economics to do the work. It has published an \xadexecutive \xadsummary online, not the entire report.\nThe New Economics Foundation (NEF) thinktank \xadcriticised the chancellor on Saturday night for the \xadjustifications she gave for backing a third \xadrunway, saying it also believed the methodology used had \xadpreviously been judged unreliable by the Department for Transport.\nAlex Chapman, senior economist at the NEF, said: “It is very concerning that the chancellor appears to be basing her support for Heathrow expansion on a figure from a report commissioned by Heathrow airport.\n“Even more worrying is the fact that the methodology they have applied is one that the Department for Transport has previously decided is not fit for purpose, and that the report uses forecast data supplied by the airport itself.\n“Heathrow expansion represents a major threat to the UK’s climate goals and flies in the face of scientific advice. To ensure that the claimed economic benefits are concrete, assessments should be carried out by independent government economists following best-practice methodology.\n“NEF’s analysis has identified a wide range of weaknesses in the economic case, which have emerged since it was last fully appraised in 2015. Not least, the decline of business air travel, the surge in outbound leisure travel and the negative impacts on wider regions of the UK – all of which erode the potential growth benefit.”\nAnalysis by climate crisis website Carbon Brief suggests that, using the government’s own figures, SAF will barely cut emissions by 2040, and any reduction will be wiped out by rising flight numbers.\nSeparately, in 2023, the Royal Society found that to grow enough crops – biofuels – to make all UK\xa0aviation fuel sustainable would\xa0require about half of UK \xadagricultural land.\nSign up to Observed\nAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers\nafter newsletter promotion\nA spokesperson at Frontier Economics defended its record as a well-regarded consultancy.\n“Frontier Economics is one of the most respected economic consultancies in Europe.

In this particular case, our results broadly match those previously found by the independent Airports Commission and the Department for Transport. We recognise this is a complex issue; our report is clear about all aspects: the costs, the benefits, the overall impact and the uncertainties.\nAoife O’Leary, chief executive of non-governmental organisation Opportunity Green, said increasing the number of flights in and out of the UK would not drive the economic growth Reeves was so desperate to deliver.\n“Business travel represents a dwindling share of flights, while foreign tourists coming into the UK and boosting our economy are \xadoutnumbered three to one by UK tourists leaving the UK to spend money abroad, taking net £41bn out of the economy. “If the government wants growth, better options for investment include boosting connectivity outside London with improved domestic public transport.” She also said that SAF was “essentially a mirage”.\nShe added: “Yes, these fuels are biofuels made from crops, cooking oils and other sources of plant biomass. But producing them takes up huge amounts of land, endangering food security and biodiversity. “Indeed, very little of these fuels even exist today and producing them at anything like the scale that will be needed to decarbonise aviation would be totally incompatible with any notions of sustainability.”\nThe Treasury was approached for comment."], 'https://www.theguardian.com/sport': ['Football Weekly', 'Let our team of writers be your guide to the cricketing world\nThe latest rugby union news and analysis direct to your inbox\nThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But please don’t do that\nWhy don’t you just leave? It’s always an incendiary question.\nWhen you ask it of people in bad romances or miserable careers, they can be forgiven for ghosting. The word “just” is the poison. As if leaving were simple. It is never simple. The reasons to stay in a job or a relationship – children, money, comfort, love – can be every bit as compelling as the reasons to hit the road.\nThe same is true in California. The annual wildfires moved fast this year, and they were relentless. In less than a week, the fires razed more than 12,300 buildings in and around Los Angeles. Twenty-five people were killed. Smoke and toxins choke the air. More than 80,000 evacuees are still shut out of their neighborhoods. The fires have only just stopped raging.\nIf you’re an out-of-towner, studying the cyclical droughts and fires and surveying images of charred neighborhoods, it’s tempting to urge Californians to get the hell out.\nHold off. Hold the hell off. This is an extremely fragile time in California. When people lose their homes, whether in fire or evacuation, they also lose clothes, family photos, a world of creature comforts and often, most heartbreakingly, pets.\nIn demanding that people leave their homes, we may be asking them to leave the most important thing of all: their communities and their loved ones. Is an actuary-calculated measure of safety from wildfires worth giving up intimacy and proximity to the people who make life worth living?\nDavid Graeber and David Wengrow put this calculus succinctly in The Dawn of Everything. “There is the security of knowing one has a statistically smaller chance of getting shot with an arrow,” they wrote. “And then there’s the security of knowing that there are people who will care deeply if one is.”\nPractically speaking, people who experience disruptions after a disaster deteriorate the fastest, says Karestan Koenen, an expert in trauma at Harvard, who investigated the psychological effects of the 2018 Paradise fire in California. “To prevent long-term mental health consequences is to address people’s basic needs for a safe place to live, for food, for work,” says Koenen.\nAnd yet, the response to the California fires from some quarters has come dangerously close to impatience, even to I-told-you-so. “The biggest thing to note about these fires in LA” said one Oregon climate expert, “is that none of this is surprising.”\nNo doubt this kind of observation is well-intended. But it’s not the time, and it never will be. Unsurprising tragedies – an addict’s overdose, a cancer patient’s death – are still tragedies.\nI lived in New York City on 9/11. As the two enormous holes were smoking, the air suffused with asbestos and death, people from out of town kept telling me the attacks were predictable to anyone who had followed developments in the Middle East. They said I should leave.\nThese people too were well-intentioned. And maybe they were right. But the bodies hadn’t even been counted. We New Yorkers hadn’t yet been able to confer with each other about the city’s present dangers and possible futures. We hadn’t grieved, we hadn’t taken inventories of our needs and our values, we hadn’t even started to plan.\nEventually, in public and private discussions among ourselves, New Yorkers, together, found clarity and confidence in our personal decision-making about whether to stay or leave. Some picked up stakes. Some stayed and took heavy precautions. Some kept calm and carried on. Some played it by ear.\nI’d like to say, as I empty my pockets and submit my bag to security goons outside every comedy show and piano recital, that I never regretted my decision. But I rethought it constantly. Now, 24 years later, I still do.\nAngelenos must be afforded the same agency, autonomy and space to make – and rethink – and qualify – and act on their own choices.

Steffen, who teaches a course on climate and personal ruggedization, emphasizes that there is no one-size-fits-all response to that reality. Instead he urges participants to “become native to now”, “develop a healthy relationship to discontinuity” and “move from climate isolation to community”.\nIsolation – now that’s something we should all leave, along with know-it-all-ism and solitary bunker-building.

But it’s going to cost a lot of money.”\nWith the potential to slash shipping times between Europe and Asia by thousands of miles – or as much as two weeks – the opening up of the Northwest Passage as the Arctic ice melts is viewed by some as an upside of the climate crisis and one of the main reasons Trump has taken such an interest in Greenland.\nWith its critical position along the highly coveted route – which passes through the Canadian Arctic archipelago instead of the traditional passage via the Panama Canal – Greenland is likely to have an important role to play in its future.\nBut the spotlight on Greenland – and, the shifting focus of the world’s superpowers on the Arctic region as a whole – has highlighted just how poorly equipped for the Arctic environment much of Europe and the US in fact is. Nowhere is this more stark than in the lack of icebreakers – the expensive specialist ships vital for operating in the Northwest Passage and the region more generally.\n“Opening up the Northwest Passage doesn’t mean the ice is gone,” says Clemensen, whose ships (not icebreakers) are used to import and export across the whole of Greenland. “We’re not talking about an all-year-round free passage. The ice is retreating, but it is still there.”\nDenmark, which is responsible for Greenland’s defence, does not have a single icebreaker – having retired its remaining three in 2010. Yet the ownership of these specialist vessels has suddenly become what could be a new front in the fight for dominance between the world’s biggest powers – commanding access to everything from shipping routes to search and rescue and minerals. Such is the attraction of Greenland that Trump has not ruled out using military force to get it.\nSince Trump’s renewed advances, Copenhagen has said it is preparing for the fact that it may have to purchase icebreakers for Arctic defence. The Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, recently visited an icebreaker in Finland – a country which has several of them. But even if she decided to order a new fleet now, the ships take several years to build.\nRussia is by far and away the icebreaker superpower. It is understood to have at least 50 icebreakers – at least 13 of which can operate in the Arctic and seven of which are nuclear – as well as a substantial network of ports in the region. China is understood to have four that are suitable for the Arctic, while new Nato members Sweden and Finland, as well as the US and Canada, all own their own versions of these specialist vessels. There are also a growing number of icebreaker cruise vessels catering to Arctic tourists.\nCommercial vessels wanting to use the passage must have icebreaking capabilities as the ice-free window, if it happens, will be as little as three months long. And even in the summer, polar-coded vessels – those, like Clemensen’s, that are designed and certified to operate safely in the harsh ice conditions of the Arctic – are needed. If Greenland’s mining were to take off then icebreakers would be essential to access minerals in the fjords when they freeze over.\nPointing to a big framed map of Greenland hanging on his office wall, Clemensen says they have the Arctic ice drifting down the east coast which closes together so that it has no gaps during the winter and moves south in summer. “That’s multi-year ice. It’s very hard and it’s big flakes. We pass it, we don’t go in and break it with our vessels.”\nThen there is the west ice, which comes from the Canadian side starting in November and building up until it closes down as far as Disko Bay on Greenland’s west coast. “When it hits Greenland then it builds up and you’re not able to pass through. That is the situation we are looking at right now and it could go for two to three months. But it depends on wind and current in the sea.”\nWhile you could get through with an icebreaker, to do so would put the livelihoods of coastal communities at risk who go out on to the ice to fish species that include shrimp, halibut, redfish and cod. The same communities also hunt seals, walrus, reindeer and small numbers of polar bear in winter.\nVittus Qujaukitsoq, a former government minister and chief executive of KNAPK, Greenland’s business association for professional fishers and hunters, says: “Some people think it would be a great help to have icebreakers [in order to help get small fishing boats out on to the water], but not everyone, because they would ruin their way of living.”\nQujaukitsoq says depleting ice and unpredictable weather caused by the climate crisis is already affecting hunting and fishing in Greenland’s rural communities. Carbon emissions are also speeding up the melting of inland ice. “It is affecting our livelihood economically, but also threatening our traditional way of living,” he says. The ice, he adds, must be safe to walk and drive on. “The safety is measured upon the thickness of the ice. In a few short periods we are able to go by car, but most of the traffic is conducted by dog sled and snowmobiles for icefishing.”\nIf the Northwest Passage were to become busier and icebreakers came through breaking up the ice at inappropriate times, he says it would have a “significant effect” on the Inuit people who live along the shipping route and “pose a threat for our existence long term”.\nJohanna Ikävalko, director of the Arctic Centre, says there is “an elevated need for high-performance icebreakers” in the region, but still considers the Northwest Passage a “very risky area for navigating”. If it were to be used to transport oil for example, the ice conditions would pose a “huge risk” even for a routine journey.\nShe is, she says, fearful for the future of the Arctic, which she predicts will form the basis for which nations become the superpowers of the future. Russia, she adds, has multiple military bases in the Artic near Murmansk which it has been developing for years. “I started to think last summer that the world order will actually start to evolve from the Arctic – and now it’s even more possible.”'], 'https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/feb/02/toronto-raptors-fans-boo-us-national-anthem-after-donald-trump-tariffs': ['Toronto Raptors fans boo US national anthem after Donald Trump tariffs', 'Fans at a Toronto Raptors game on Sunday continued an emerging trend of booing the American national anthem at sporting events in Canada.\nFans of the NBA’s lone Canadian franchise booed the US anthem before the Raptors’ game against the Los Angeles Clippers at the Scotiabank Arena in downtown Toronto. Similar reactions broke out on Saturday night at NHL games in Ottawa and Calgary, where the Senators and Flames faced the Minnesota Wild and Detroit Red Wings respectively. Those games came hours after Donald Trump made his threat of import tariffs on Canada a reality.\nAfter Raptors fans initially cheered the 15-year-old girl singing the anthems, they booed throughout her performance of The Star-Spangled Banner. At the end, mixed boos and cheers could be heard before the crowd erupted in applause for the Canadian anthem, O Canada. Three of the five starters on the Raptors are American and they glanced at each other as the boos rang out. Sportsnet reporter Michael Grange, who was at the game, wrote on X that fans emphasised the word “free” in the Canadian anthem. The game ended in a 115-108 victory for the Raptors.\nRaptors forward Garrett Temple, who is American, said the players were well aware of the booing.\n“Yeah, of course I noticed it,” he said. “The reaction [was], ‘Wow.’ And then you just think about why they’re booing. A lot of things bigger than basketball going on in the world right now. At the end of the day, we play in an arena that’s in Canada and they’re Canadian citizens, so they have a certain feeling about the trade situation going on, the tariffs. The people that booed let their thoughts be known.”\nOne of the Raptors’ Canadian players, Kelly Olynyk, said he had had sympathy for the anthem singer.\n“Obviously [the tariffs have] an impact on a lot of people in this country and in this stadium,” he said. “I felt bad for the girl singing but they cheered her at the end, so I was happy for that.”\nOn Saturday, Trump placed tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico and China after claiming the three countries allow immigrants and illegal drugs into the US. In addition, energy imported from Canada, including oil, natural gas and electricity, will be taxed at a 10% rate.\nCanadian prime minister Justin Trudeau and Mexico’s president have ordered retaliatory tariffs on goods from America in response.\n The booing of The Star-Spangled Banner in Canada is rare, but not unheard of especially when tied to world events. In the early 2000s, fans at games in Canada booed to show their disapproval of the US-led war in Iraq.\nTrump has been the subject of booing himself at sports events. During his first term as president he was jeered and greeted with “lock him up” chants by Washington Nationals fans during the 2019 World Series. He has also been cheered loudly at college football games.'], 'https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/feb/02/grammy-2025-winners': ['Grammy awards 2025: list of winners', 'The biggest night in music has so far seen wins for Sabrina Carpenter, Charli xcx, Kendrick Lamar and Beyoncé\nBenson BooneSabrina Carpenter\n  DoechiiKhruangbinRayeChappell Roan – WINNER\n  ShaboozeyTeddy Swims\nBeyoncé – Cowboy Carter – WINNER\n  Post Malone – F-1 TrillionKacey Musgraves – Deeper WellChris Stapleton – HigherLainey Wilson – Whirlwind\nSabrina Carpenter – Short n’ Sweet – WINNER\n  Billie Eilish – Hit Me Hard and SoftAriana Grande – Eternal Sunshine\n  Chappell Roan – The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess\n  Taylor Swift – The Tortured Poets Department\nJ Cole – Might Delete Later\n Common and Pete Rock – The Auditorium, Vol 1Doechii – Alligator Bites Never Heal – WINNER\n Eminem – The Death of Slim Shady (Coup De Grâce)\n Future and Metro Boomin – We Don’t Trust You\nBeyoncé – BodyguardSabrina Carpenter – Espresso – WINNER\n Charli xcx – Apple\n Billie Eilish – Birds of a Feather\n Chappell Roan – Good Luck, Babe!\nCharli xcx – Brat – WINNER\n Four Tet – Three\n Justice – Hyperdrama\n Kaytranada – Timeless\n Zedd – Telos\nThe Beatles – Now and Then – WINNER\n The Black Keys – Beautiful People (Stay High)\n Green Day – The American Dream Is Killing Me\n Idles – Gift Horse\n Pearl Jam – Dark Matter\n St Vincent – Broken Man\nCardi B – Enough (Miami)\n Common and Pete Rock featuring Posdnuos – When the Sun Shines Again\n Doechii – Nissan Altima\n Eminem – Houdini\n Future and Metro Boomin featuring Kendrick Lamar – Like That\n GloRilla – Yeah Glo!Kendrick Lamar – Not Like Us – WINNER\nRapsody featuring Hit-Boy – Asteroids\n ¥$ [Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign] featuring Rich the Kid and Playboi Carti – Carnival\n Future and Metro Boomin featuring Kendrick Lamar – Like ThatKendrick Lamar – Not Like Us – WINNER\n GloRilla – Yeah Glo!\nNick Cave & the Bad Seeds – Wild God\n Clairo – Charm\n Kim Gordon – The Collective\n Brittany Howard – What NowSt Vincent – All Born Screaming – WINNER\nBeyoncé – 16 Carriages\n Jelly Roll – I Am Not Okay\n Kacey Musgraves – The Architect\n Shaboozey – A Bar Song (Tipsy)Chris Stapleton – It Takes a Woman – WINNER\nKelsea Ballerini with Noah Kahan – Cowboys Cry TooBeyoncé featuring Miley Cyrus – II Most Wanted – WINNER\n Brothers Osborne – Break Mine\n Dan + Shay – Bigger Houses\n Post Malone featuring Morgan Wallen – I Had Some Help\nJordan Adetunji featuring Kehlani – Kehlani\n Beyoncé featuring Linda Martell and Shaboozey – Spaghettii\n Future and Metro Boomin featuring the Weeknd – We Still Don’t Trust You\n Latto – Big MamaRapsody featuring Erykah Badu – 3:AM – WINNER\nMadison Beer – Make You MineCharli xcx – Von Dutch – WINNER\n Billie Eilish – L’Amour de Ma Vie (Over Now Extended Edit)\n Ariana Grande – Yes, And?\n Troye Sivan – Got Me Started\nDisclosure – She’s Gone, Dance On\n Four Tet – Loved\n Fred Again.. and Baby Keem – LeavemealoneJustice and Tame Impala – Neverender – WINNERKaytranada featuring Childish Gambino – Witchy\nJhené Aiko – Guidance\n Chris Brown – Residuals\n Coco Jones – Here We Go (Uh Oh)Muni Long – Made for Me (Live on BET) – WINNER\n SZA – Saturn\nMarsha Ambrosius – Wet\n Kenyon Dixon – Can I Have This Groove\n Lalah Hathaway featuring Michael McDonald – No Lie\n Muni Long – Make Me ForgetLucky Daye – That’s You – WINNER\nRicky Gervais – ArmageddonDave Chappelle – The Dreamer – WINNER\n Jim Gaffigan – The Prisoner\n Nikki Glaser – Someday You’ll Die\n Trevor Noah – Where Was I\nKehlani – After Hours\n Tems – Burning\n Coco Jones – Here We Go (Uh Oh)\n Muni Long – Ruined MeSZA – Saturn – WINNER\nAvery*Sunshine – So Glad to Know You – WINNER – tieDurand Bernarr – En Route\n  Childish Gambino – Bando Stone and the New World\n  Kehlani – CrashNxWorries (Anderson .Paak and Knxwledge) – Why Lawd? – WINNER – tie\nChris Brown – 11:11 (Deluxe) – WINNER\n Lalah Hathaway – Vantablack\n Muni Long – Revenge\n Lucky Daye – Algorithm\n Usher – Coming Home\nAmerican Patchwork Quartet – American Patchwork Quartet\n Madi Diaz – Weird Faith\n Adrianne Lenker – Bright Future\n Aoife O’Donovan – All My FriendsGillian Welch and David Rawlings – Woodland – WINNER\nBad Bunny – Nadie Sabe lo Que Va a Pasar Mañana\n J Balvin – Rayo\n Feid – FerxxocalipsisResidente – Las Letras Ya No Importan – WINNERYoung Miko – Att.\nGojira, Marina Viotti and Victor Le Masne – Mea Culpa (Ah!

The civil protection ministry said schools would be shut as a precautionary measure on Monday.\n“Nothing can be ruled out,” Kostas Papazachos, a professor of geophysics at Thessaloniki’s Aristotle University, told the state broadcaster ERT. “And that’s why precautionary measures are being put in place, precisely to limit the impact of a stronger earthquake.”\nGreece sits on multiple faultlines and is often rattled by earthquakes, but experts described the increased seismic activity over the space of 48 hours, with more than 200 tremors registered, as dramatic, although they emphasised that the tremors had been triggered by tectonic rather than volcanic activity.\nPapazachos told local media that many of the earthquakes measured 4 to 4.5 on the Richter scale, with the strongest recorded in waters between Santorini and Amorgos.\nThe site of one the largest volcanic eruptions in recorded history, Santorini is also Greece’s most popular Aegean isle, attracting an estimated 3.5 million tourists last year.\nBy early evening on Sunday as similar measures were taken on Amorgos and the nearby islets of Ios and Anafi, rescue teams in Santorini pitched tents in elevated areas on basketball courts and in car parks. In the event of a tsunami, people were told to head inland.\nFerry companies said there had been an increase in foreign workers leaving the island for the port of Piraeus. A UK government travel advisory referred to guidance issued by the Greek civil protection ministry on earthquakes.\nResearch has shown the crust beneath the seas around Santorini to be replete with faultlines.

The Army Corps of Engineers is surveying and preparing to begin significant salvage operations on Monday to remove the wreckage from the river.\nThe transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, toured the morning TV shows and said federal aviation investigators needed space to conduct their inquiry.\n“What was happening inside the towers? Were they understaffed? … The position of the Black Hawk, the elevation of the Black Hawk, were the pilots of the Black Hawk wearing night vision goggles?” Duffy asked on CNN.\nThe American Airlines flight, with 64 people on board was preparing to land from Wichita, Kansas. The Army Black Hawk helicopter was on a training mission and had three soldiers on board. Both aircraft plunged to the Potomac River after colliding.\nThe plane’s passengers included figure skaters returning from the 2025 US figure skating championships in Wichita, Kansas, and a group of hunters returning from a guided trip.\nArmy staff sgt Ryan Austin O’Hara, 28, of Lilburn, Georgia; chief warrant officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves, 39, of Great Mills, Maryland; and Cpt Rebecca M Lobach, of Durham, North Carolina, were killed in the helicopter.\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said on Saturday that preliminary data showed conflicting readings about the altitudes of the airliner and the Army helicopter. Investigators also said that about a second before impact, the jet’s flight recorder showed a change in its pitch. But they did not say whether that change in angle meant that pilots were trying to perform an evasive maneuver to avoid the crash.\nData from the jet’s flight recorder showed its altitude as 325ft (99 meters), plus or minus 25ft (7.6 meters), when the crash happened, NTSB officials told reporters. Data in the control tower, though, showed the Black Hawk at 200ft (61 meters), the maximum allowed altitude for helicopters in the area.\nThe discrepancy has yet to be explained.\nInvestigators hope to reconcile the difference with data from the helicopter’s black box, which is taking more time to retrieve because it became waterlogged after the Black Hawk plunged into the Potomac. They also plan to refine the tower data, which can be less reliable.\nFull NTSB investigations typically take at least a year, though investigators hope to have a preliminary report within 30 days.\nOn Fox News Sunday, Duffy said the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was looking into staffing in the Reagan Airport control tower.\nInvestigators said there were five controllers on duty at the time of the crash: a local controller, ground controller, assistant controller, a supervisor and supervisor in training.\nAccording to an FAA report obtained by the Associated Press, one controller was responsible for helicopter and plane traffic. Those duties are often divided between two people but the airport typically combines them at 9.30pm, once traffic slows down. On Wednesday, the tower supervisor combined them earlier, which the report called “not normal”.\n“Staffing shortages for air traffic control has been a major problem for years and years,” Duffy said, promising that President Donald Trump’s administration would address shortages with “bright, smart, brilliant people in towers controlling airspace”.\nWednesday’s crash was the deadliest in the US since Nov. 12, 2001, when a jet slammed into a residential neighborhood in the New York City borough of Queens, just after takeoff from Kennedy Airport. The crash killed all 260 people on board and five people on the ground.\nExperts regularly highlight that plane travel is overwhelmingly safe, but the crowded airspace around Reagan National can challenge even the most experienced pilots.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report'], 'https://www.theguardian.com/travel': ['Travel', ''], 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-crisis+commentisfree/commentisfree': 'Error: Could not find an article body', 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/middleeast': ['Middle East and north Africa', ''], 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/feb/02/fire-chiefs-warn-uk-not-prepared-climate-crisis-impacts': ['Fire chiefs warn UK is not prepared for climate crisis impacts', 'Exclusive: National Fire Chiefs Council says firefighters’ ability to respond is at risk as it calls for preventive action\nThe UK is not prepared for the impact of climate breakdown, fire chiefs have said, as they called on the government to take urgent action to protect communities.\nThe National Fire Chiefs Council (NFCC) said the ability of fire services to tackle weather-related emergencies was at risk, despite them often being the primary frontline response to major weather events including flooding, fires caused by heatwaves, and storm-related emergencies, all of which are becoming more common.\nThe organisation, which represents the bosses of fire and rescue services across the UK, called for further investment and access to longer-term forecasting to enable them to maintain their “business as usual” service while “managing the significant resource and staffing pressures that the response to such incidents creates”.\nIt said fire and rescue workers were increasingly being forced to go “above and beyond” in responding to flooding and other dangerous weather events, from Storm Babet in October 2023 when more than 1,000 homes were flooded and three people died, to Storm Darragh which killed two people in December last year. January brought Storm \u200b\u200bÉowyn, which broke wind speed records and caused significant damage, particularly in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Ireland.\nThe Met Office predicts that winters by 2070 will be as much as 4.5C warmer and 30% wetter than they were in 1990, while summers may be up to 6C warmer and 60% drier. The south of England is projected to face temperatures reaching 40C (104F) and rainfall is expected to increase by a quarter.\nThe NFCC chair, Mark Hardingham, said: “Watching the devastation caused by the wildfires in Los Angeles and the number of recent flooding incidents we have seen in the UK, it is impossible not to be concerned about the very real and immediate threat climate change poses to our planet and what that will mean for our communities in the future.\n“Fire and rescue services are on the frontline of responding to extreme weather events and we see firefighters, control officers and other emergency service partners repeatedly going above and beyond to protect their communities. But we are seeing the risks around extreme weather increasing and, without adequate investment and further action from government, our capacity to keep communities safe and protect infrastructure is at risk.”\nAs well as responding to emergencies, fire crews form a key part of local resilience forums, multiagency partnerships made up of representatives from local public services including emergency services, local authorities, the NHS, the Environment Agency and others.\nThese groups, of which there are 38 in England and four in Wales – Scotland and Northern Ireland have a different but similar system – help with planning, preparing and recovering from emergencies.\nBen Brook, the chief fire officer for Warwickshire and the NFCC lead on environment and climate change, said: “Fire and rescue services form part of local resilience forums and work collaboratively with partners to plan for and respond to extreme weather events.\n“However, we are concerned that fire and rescue services and local resilience forums do not have access to accurate data analysis mechanisms and the expertise to use this for predictive modelling which would allow for longer-term forecasting and risk management planning. We have also found that local resilience forums are under-resourced and lack clarity when it comes to their climate change resilience role.”\nThe NFCC called for a review of the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 and/or the UK government resilience framework, both of which deal with national emergency planning and prevention, to reflect the threat posed by the climate crisis.\nIn 2022, London firefighters faced their busiest day since the second world war as a result of a heatwave, declaring a major incident alongside Leicestershire and South Yorkshire services, which also battled fires as a result of prolonged hot, dry weather during July.\nThat year there were 983 wildfires recorded in England and Wales, a rise of 315% from 2021 and 573% compared with 2020.'], 'https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/sep/20/sign-up-for-the-first-edition-newsletter-our-free-news-email': ['Sign up for the First Edition newsletter: our free daily news email', 'Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean'], 'https://www.theguardian.com/fashion': ['Fashion', "Sign up for Fashion Statement\nStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solved\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Iceland has a reputation as a world leader on feminism, but until recently women have not been able to work as guides to wild salmon fishing for visiting anglers – a job that has traditionally been the preserve of men.\nThe 21-year-old engineering student, her sister Alexandra Ósk, 16, and their friends Arndís Inga Árnadóttir, 18, and her sister Áslaug Anna, 15, are now the first generation of female guides on their river in northern Iceland, and among the very first female fishing guides in the country.\nBut after thousands of salmon escaped from an offshore fish farm in 2023, threatening the wild salmon population of multiple rivers, Andrea fears the job and the livelihood she has grown up with may not exist to pass on to her own children.\n“To think this is something I might not be able to do my whole life is really not fun at all,” she said. “It’s really heartbreaking, not only for us but for nature itself.”\nThe four young women are the subjects of an upcoming documentary, Strengur (or Tight Lines), directed by Gagga Jónsdóttir. The film, shot in part during the salmon escape, explores the young women’s relationships with one another, their fathers, fishing and its future.\nSalmon that escape from farms threaten wild salmon in multiple ways. They can carry disease and parasites, especially sea lice, and when interbreeding occurs, the offspring mature faster and younger, undermining the ability of the species to reproduce in nature.\nThe women continue to catch sea-farmed salmon that have almost certainly bred with the wild Atlantic salmon. That open-pen sea farms have not been banned is staggering to Andrea. “I really don’t understand how the Icelandic government is not doing more about this – and also, how are we not learning from Norway?” she said.\nLast year 33 rivers were closed to fishers in Norway after a collapse in the wild salmon population. “A lot of Norwegian rivers have been ruined by farmed salmon. How can we have that evidence and still not do anything about this?” Andrea said.\n“If this goes unchanged for more time the Atlantic wild salmon will go extinct. It’s not if, it’s when,” Andrea said.\nConsumers, she said, should not eat sea-farmed salmon; the only farmed salmon she ate was farmed in tanks on land.\n“I hope to do this [guiding] as long as I live and also pass this down to my children as my dad has,” she said. “I’m hoping something will change. There are a lot of people in Iceland fighting for change, so hopefully it will pay off.”\nDespite fishing being very male-dominated, Andrea has grown up around the sport. She learned to cast a flyfishing rod and fish for salmon when she was eight years old. Her first fishing memory is her father catching a big salmon. “He had someone drive me down to the river so I could watch him fight the salmon,” she said.\nAndrea attributes the lack of women in the business to household gender roles of the past, when women ran the home and men were out on the farm. But she hopes the film, which comes out in spring, will encourage more women to try fishing. “The peace I feel standing by the river and casting, it’s just something about it that’s deep in my roots,” she said.\nGagga, whose previous work includes the 2021 film Stitch ’n’ Bitch, which she directed, and Agnes Joy, which she co-wrote and produced, said she was initially drawn by the story of the young women rather than the subject of salmon fishing. But during the course of filming, when she witnessed first-hand the devastating impact of the salmon farm escape, she also became heavily invested in the fate of wild salmon.\n“I didn’t go in there raging politically,” she said, but what she witnessed during filming activated her. “It is sad. What are [the young women] going to do? Work in a sea pen factory? It’s also all this knowledge of our environment, that is something we are losing and that is a bad thing for all of us.”\nOpen sea pens should be banned, Gagga said. “It’s not just a question about Iceland, it’s a question about the species, the Atlantic salmon. It’s for the whole world.”\nBut she found hope in the boundary-breaking actions of the female guides. “They say the world is changing and the systems of the men are falling apart, and I could feel it when I was making the film.”'], 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/01/leaders-in-the-pacific-raise-alarm-over-direct-impact-of-trumps-climate-retreat-and-aid-freeze': ['Leaders in the Pacific raise alarm over ‘direct impact’ of Trump’s climate retreat and aid freeze', 'Samoa’s prime minister says US withdrawal from Paris climate agreement is ‘very disappointing’ and puts the survival of Pacific countries at greater risk\nLeaders and environmental advocates in the Pacific have expressed alarm over Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement and freeze foreign aid, warning the moves will accelerate the existential threats they face as nations on the frontlines of the climate crisis.\nThe Paris agreement is the world’s main effort to address the impacts of the climate crisis. Trump has called it “unfair” and a “rip off”.\nIn an interview with the Guardian, Samoa’s prime minister Fiame Naomi Mataʻafa described Trump’s move to pull out of the Paris agreement as “very disappointing,” saying it would undermine global climate action and put the survival of Pacific countries at greater risk.\n“We look to the US as a global leader, but they seem to not recognise this global issue, not only for Samoa but for the Pacific,” Fiame said.\n“It’s not surprising … nevertheless, it is very disappointing,” the prime minister said.\nA freeze on US foreign aid has deepened concerns that the Pacific region will suffer further as crucial assistance for climate adaptation, disaster management, extreme weather resilience is cut, or under threat. In addition, Fiame told the Guardian Pacific countries would be “seriously impacted” by the withdrawal from the World Health Organisation and other multilateral bodies.\n“These are the forums that small countries rely on; they are critical to our voices being heard and our causes being addressed,” she said.\nUnder the Biden administration, Washington increased its engagement with Pacific island nations, emphasising climate change as a central concern. In 2022, then-vice president Kamala Harris announced a substantial aid boost, pledging to triple US assistance to the region to $600m.\nDespite their minimal contribution, Pacific nations face severe and disproportionate climate impacts including rising sea levels, coastal erosion, loss of freshwater sources, and potential displacement. Additionally, extreme weather events such as tropical cyclones, floods, and droughts continue to devastate infrastructure, homes, and economies across the region.\nThe Paris agreement is the first legally binding climate treaty to explicitly recognise loss and damage as a separate pillar of climate action, distinct from mitigation and adaptation. This marked a significant victory for Pacific island countries, which had long pushed for its recognition in global climate negotiations.\nPapua New Guinea’s prime minister, James Marape, told PNG media that the US withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement was “morally wrong.”\n“The United States has recently revitalised its relations with the Pacific, and it is very discouraging to see it backing down from climate talks, which have a direct impact on climate change mitigation for us in the Pacific,” Marape said.\n“We continue to be subjected to rising sea levels and unpredictable weather patterns that impact lives and economies.”\nFrom fiscal years 2017 through 2023, US agencies provided more than $420.3m to address climate risks in 14 Pacific Island countries and three US territories in the Pacific, according to the US government accountability office. US-funded projects include climate resilience initiatives and livelihood protection in Papua New Guinea’s rural highland communities, and the development of early warning systems for remote communities in Fiji.\nSamoa-based Sefanaia Nawadra is director-general of the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP), an organisation that works with Pacific governments on environmental protection. He described the US climate policy shifts as “disheartening” and said the Pacific must now “work harder and smarter, together and with all available partners to meet the needs of our people.”\n“Climate change represents the single greatest threat to our region,” he said.\nHowever, SPREP notes that other partners may step in to fill funding gaps left by the US. Pacific nations receive climate funding and support from a range of other governments – including Australia, the UK, China and Japan – and also access financial support from multilateral organisations.\nNawadra said Pacific countries “will continue to seek and receive support from existing partnerships” to address their adaptation and mitigation needs.\nPacific climate campaigner Jacynta Faʻamau of 350.org said the climate crisis was “the greatest security threat to the Pacific,” while emphasising the region’s resilience.\n“Island nations are committing to scaling up their own renewable energy plans and doing their part to secure our futures.\n“The government of the US and the rest of the global north have a lot to answer for in terms of historical responsibility for the climate crisis, but they are no longer who we are looking to for leadership,” she said.'], 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jan/31/more-carrot-less-stick-how-meat-loving-danes-were-sold-a-plant-led-world-first': ['‘Insanely tasty green food’: how the meaty Danes embraced a world-first plant-based plan', 'Agreement between farmers, politicians and environmental groups led to a €170m action fund for plant based food\n“Plant-based foods are the future.” That is not a statement you would expect from a right-wing farming minister in a major meat-producing nation. Denmark produces more meat per capita than any other country in the world, with its 6 million people far outnumbered by its 30 million pigs, and it has a big dairy industry too. Yet this is how Jacob Jensen, from the Liberal party, introduced the nation’s world-first action plan for plant-based foods.\n“If we want to reduce the climate footprint within the agricultural sector, then we all have to eat more plant-based foods,” he said at the plan’s launch in October 2023, and since then the scheme has gone from strength to strength. Backed by a €170m government fund, it is now supporting plant-based food from farm to fork, from making tempeh from broad beans and a chicken substitute from fungi to on-site tastings at kebab and burger shops and the first vegan chef degree.\nGlobally, animal farming produces 12%-20% of total global greenhouse gas emissions and significant cuts in meat and dairy consumption in rich countries is essential to tackling the climate crisis, scientists say. However, attempts to curb the huge impact of livestock on the environment in other countries have usually descended rapidly into bitter culture wars and tractors on the streets in protest.\nSo how did Denmark’s plan to promote beans and vegetables come to get widespread support and funding?\nFood is deeply personal and has enormous cultural significance, making it a minefield for climate action. So the transition away from meat and towards plant-based eating had to be approached delicately, says Rune-Christoffer Dragsdahl, head of the Vegetarian Society of Denmark and one of the key actors in delivering the Danish plan. Dragsdahl says, appropriately enough, that carrots not sticks were crucial to getting agreement on the policy.\n“One of the key reasons was talking about what we want more of, instead of talking about what we want less of, that is how we got broader support,” he says. “There was a delicate balance. People had to feel welcome, even when they had not just differing opinions, but maybe even different versions of the truth. This was a tricky but important balance, because that’s how you secure the continued participation of people.”\nGetting farmers on board was vital and the Vegetarian Society had been putting on friendly events for food producers. Then, in 2021, it was invited to help the Danish Agriculture and Food Council (DAFC) produce the plant-based food strategy.\nAnders Martin Klöcker, the DAFC innovation director, says: “I am proud of that, because it was an unusual alliance.” Nonetheless, landing the action plan was tricky.\n“It was controversial,” says Klöcker. “You have a farming sector which has been predominantly based on animal products for centuries. They have difficulty understanding that now we should shift the diet.”\nThe plant-based food plan was part of a bigger farming deal that also supported animal agriculture. “We consider it a ‘both-and’ not an ‘either-or’,” says Klöcker. “We don’t want it to be polarised. We consider [plant-based food] a market that’s interesting, which is also growing.”\nThe support from farmers shifted the politics, says Dragsdahl: “It clearly helped make the right-wing parties more neutral, and thereby also made the central parties more daring – it was really important.”\nA politician who had a key role in finalising the action plan was Zenia Stampe, agriculture spokesperson for the centrist Social Liberal party. The task was initially daunting, she says: “Farming is still a big part of our identity and while climate was such a hot topic then, agriculture was not a part of that debate at all.”\nStampe remembers an “eye-opening” early meeting with Dragsdahl, where she learned that a quarter of Denmark’s greenhouse gas emissions come from agriculture, with livestock and feed crops occupying 80% of farmland.\n“But the [Vegetarian Society and other allied groups] knew it was such a big taboo in Denmark, so they turned it around and presented plant-based food as a business opportunity,” she says. “I think that is the key to understanding why this succeeded.”\nThe plant-based action plan also avoided using the terms vegan and vegetarian, which can be polarising, and did not set targets for cutting meat consumption or livestock numbers. It dished out its first grants last year.\nThe new fully-government-funded degree at Copenhagen Hospitality College now has its first 26 students, who can choose either vegetarian or vegan paths. Thais Brask-Simonsen from catering company Compass Group says: “Vegetarian cuisine is booming, and both restaurants and canteens are screaming for this expertise.” Student Magda says connecting food and sustainability is vital: “I want to contribute by making some insanely tasty green food that makes people not miss meat.”\nThe Vegetarian Society also has funding to work on better menu design. “You still find many places where there’s one vegan item at the bottom of the menu, which is just called vegan dish of the day, so it’s only chosen by very few people,” says Dragsdahl. “But if you call it something delicious, put it first on the menu, and maybe even have three vegan options, and then three meat options, many more people choose the veggie options.”\nOne grant, won by the Association of Agricultural Colleges, is an appeal to the belly of farmers themselves. It is training the chefs that feed the student farmers in plant-based cooking, as well as include more pulses in the curriculum. “It should help normalise plant-based meals,” says Dragsdahl.\nOther grants focus on developing new plant-based products, and improving the taste and texture of meat and dairy alternatives. Klöcker would like to see more focus on product development, which he says has to go hand-in-hand with building demand to create successful businesses, and more focus on export opportunities – 85% of Danish food is sold overseas.\nA new €7bn green farming deal in 2024 saw a commitment from the Danish government to work towards an EU-wide action plan for plant-based foods. It has already been credited with influencing Portugal’s recent decision to produce an action plan for a low-carbon diet, and Denmark takes over the rotating presidency of the European Commission in July.\nDenmark was a leader in wind energy and in banning trans fats in food. But whether its plant-based food plan, still in its nascent stage, is similarly successful remains to be seen. So far it has certainly made farming the hottest climate issue in Denmark, but will it ultimately shift diets?\n“The theory of change is hopefully that the plan and fund will lead to an actual transformation, with less intensive livestock,” says Dragsdahl.\nStampe is unsure: “I hope so. But to be honest, I don’t know yet. There will always be some people, saying: ‘Yeah, if you eat less meat, then I will eat more!’”\nThe deal in 2024 saw sticks added to the carrots, with a world-first tax on emissions from livestock, a plan to convert 140,000 hectares (346,000 acres) of low-lying farmland into natural areas and to establish 250,000 hectares of new forest.\nBut Stampe says animal farming still gets far more government support than plant-based production. “The solutions to the climate crisis are not in the margins,” she says. “It is in the big shifts. So not from one type of animal production to another type of animal, but from animal-based to plant based food.”\nKlöcker accepts that even the best-produced animal products have bigger climate footprints than plant-based ones, and like Stampe sees a generational shift with younger people eating less meat.\n“But we have to have a market to do anything at all,” he says, and he does not think a transition to more plant-based eating will be fast.\nKlöcker points out that it took 30 years of nurturing supply and demand for organic food to reach today’s 12% market share in Denmark: “The worst thing would be a farmer or food company realising that [plant-based products] they developed don’t have a market – then you might really lose them for good.”\nDragsdahl is more optimistic, but says continuing a measured approach will be essential: “There is a strong majority of Danes who are open to eating less meat. They understand it might be good for their health and the environment, but we should really not push it too hard or too far. Because then these people will just say: ‘Fuck off, it’s my plate.’”\nThis article was amended on 31 January 2025.

Heatwaves were the biggest disrupter, affecting 171 million students.\nEvery public school in Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory has access to air conditioned learning spaces, according to education department spokespeople.\nQueensland also had air conditioning in “every classroom, library and staff room” in every Queensland state school, an education department spokesperson said.\nOther jurisdictions are making progress but Parents for Climate estimates that hundreds of New South Wales schools have no air conditioning.\nA NSW education department spokesperson said that since July 2024, the government had “delivered millions in funding to repair and replace air conditioning units statewide ahead of summer”.\nIn Victoria, air conditioning is provided “based on the location of the school and the type of buildings classes are taught in”, a departmental spokesperson said.\nAdequate cooling isn’t the only concern in a heatwave, according to Correna Haythorpe, federal president of the Australian Education Union.\nHaythorpe, who has direct experience of teaching in extreme heat, said when students were kept inside at lunchtime, they didn’t get to play and “let off steam” – no pun intended.\nThe task of supervising hundreds of children indoors – in classrooms and corridors – requires “all hands on deck” from staff, she said, which means teachers often don’t get a break.\nExtreme heat and dehydration is a health, safety and wellbeing concern for staff and students, she said, with high temperatures making it harder for everyone to focus on teaching and learning.\nResearch shows the best learning temperature is between 22 and 24C – learning gets harder every degree it increases.\nAll states and territories recommend schools make adjustments during excessive heat – postponing sports or outdoor excursions, moving activities indoors, and encouraging students to drink plenty of water.\nQueensland guidanceincludes postponing or cancelling physical activity when the temperature exceeds 36C and relative humidity is more than 30%.\nHeatwaves are Australia’s deadliest natural phenomenon, killing more people than bushfires, floods and storms.\nChildren are particularly vulnerable, according to Michelle Isles, the chief executive of the Climate and Health Alliance.\n“Children sweat more per kilogram,” she said. “They’ve got a higher metabolism, which means they get hot quicker. They also spend a lot more time outside.”\nBut the signs of heatstroke and stress aren’t as obvious in children, she warned.\nWhile some states have policies, Isles said there should be minimum requirements for cool classrooms, including backup plans in case of power outages and clear triggers for when it’s too hot to play outside.\nIdeally, heat plans would include safe travel to and from school, she said, such as cooler pathways for walking and cycling and preventing idling at pick up times.\nParents are encouraged to send their children to school with a water bottle, hat and insulated lunchbox, and wearing sunscreen.\nFor quick advice, Seton recommends Heatwatch, a University of Sydney tool that forecasts heat health risks and provides tips to stay cool.'], 'https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?INTCMP=DOTCOM_FOOTER_NEWSLETTER_INTERNATIONAL': ['Newsletters', "Choose from 61 available newsletters.

It’s that Canada and Mexico retaliated immediately and that others, ie China and the EU, may follow their lead, resulting in a sharp contraction in global trade.”\nCanadian and Mexican exports to the US will face a 25% tariff starting on Tuesday, and there will be a 10% levy on energy resources from Canada.\nTrump said the move was in response to a “major threat” from illegal immigration and drugs, and demanded both countries staunch the flow of fentanyl and illegal immigrants.\nImports from China will face a 10% tariff on top of existing US charges.\nTrump also told reporters he would “absolutely” put tariffs on goods from the European Union, claiming the EU had treated the US “terribly”.\nEconomists fear that the trade war could push Canada and Mexico into recession.\nDeutsche Bank’s top currency strategist, George Saravelos, said if Trump’s tariffs went ahead, they would be the “largest shock” in global trade policy since the end of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates half a century ago.\n“We see immediate recessionary consequences for some of the economies involved and broad-based negative read-across to the world economy,” Saravelos added.\nPaul Ashworth, the chief North America economist at Capital Economics, warned that Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China was “just the first strike in what could become a very destructive global trade war”.\n“Imports from the European Union will be hit within the next month or two and a universal tariff is coming in April. Since exports to the US account for around 20% of their GDP, today’s tariffs could plunge both the Canadian and Mexican economies into recession later this year,” Ashworth added.\nCanada was swift to respond. The prime minister, Justin Trudeau, announced a tit-for-tat 25% tariff phased in across C$155bn (£86bn) worth of American products.\nMexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, ordered her economy minister to implement tariff and non-tariff measures in response, while China’s commerce ministry pledged to file a “lawsuit” against the US at the World Trade Organization.\nTrump’s tariffs include a retaliation clause to ratchet them up if Mexico, Canada or China try to impose their own tariffs in response.\nSign up to Business Today\nGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning\nafter newsletter promotion\nAnalysts and energy traders have predicted that US motor fuel prices are likely to rise because of tariffs on Canadian and Mexican oil.\nChris Weston, the head of research at the brokerage Pepperstone, predicted Trump’s announcement would lead to “some derisking” in the markets, and higher volatility on foreign exchanges.\n“With Trump placing an additional 25% tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports and adding 10% to the current tariff rate on Chinese imports (with limited carve-outs), one can say that this outcome comes close to representing the most hardlined approach of all the possible scenarios we had considered,” Weston wrote.\n“Talk of recession risk in Canada will surely increase and [it] should also raise the prospect that the Mexican central bank will cut the overnight rate by 50bp when Banxico meet on Thursday.”\nBitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, dropped to a two-week low below $97,000 on Sunday.\nSouth Korea’s acting president, Choi Sang-mok, ordered government agencies to closely monitor any impact from the new tariffs on domestic firms and the South Korean economy.\nTrump denied that the tariffs, which are paid when goods enter the US, would push up prices. “Tariffs don’t cause inflation,” he said. “They cause success.”\nBut economists expect the cost to be passed on to US consumers.\nThe Harvard economics professor Lawrence Summers, a former US secretary of the treasury, said the tariffs against Canada and Mexico were “inexplicable and dangerous”.\n“Much of what we export involves imported inputs. Cars move back and forth across the border between five and 10 times during assembly. This makes the whole of North America much less competitive, relative to Europe and Japan,” Summers posted on X.\nKlaas Knot, a member of the European Central Bank’s governing council, predicted Trump’s tariffs would lead to higher inflation and interest rates in the US that are likely to weaken the euro.\nKnot, who is also the Netherlands’ central bank president, told the Dutch television programme Buitenhof that trade wars harm all sides.\n“Europe will not want to be pushed around.

In the memo, which was reviewed by the Guardian, officials instructed website managers across the agency to “identify and archive or unpublish any landing pages focused on climate change” . It also included a Friday deadline to list the mentions in a spreadsheet for further review.\nOn Friday, USDA officials clarified that the content should not be deleted. “USDA needs to adhere to requirements around records retention, so Archive or Unpublish landing pages focused on climate change,” an email sent to agency public affairs directors read.\nAs of publication, the USDA’s Climate Hubs – helpful sites that connect producers to local programs and research – are still live, but many sites were down, including the USFS Climate Change Resource Center, the Climate Action Tracker and the National Roadmap for Responding to Climate Change.\nThe sites featured important tools and information to help mitigate the effects of the climate crisis and research.

Yes, maybe (and maybe not!)” Trump wrote on Sunday in all capital letters on his Truth social media platform, a day after signing off on tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China.\n“But we will Make America Great Again, and it will all be worth the price that must be paid,” he added.\nDonald Trump acknowledged that the sweeping tariffs he has imposed on Mexico, Canada and China may cause “some pain” for Americans, but said they were necessary to curb illegal immigration and the drug trade. “The USA has major deficits with Canada, Mexico, and China (and almost all countries!), owes 36 Trillion Dollars, and we’re not going to be the ‘Stupid Country’ any longer,” Trump said on Truth Social.\nTop Democrats slammed Donald Trump’s tariff plans, warning that they will hit working families and small businesses hard. Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, led the charge by saying the president’s threatened tariffs would likely “hit Americans in their wallets”. “It would be nice if Donald Trump could start focusing on getting the prices down instead of making them go up.”\nCanada said it will take legal action under the relevant international bodies to challenge the 25% tariffs, a day after prime minster Justin Trudeau announced a wide array of concrete measures including a tit-for-tat 25% tariff phased in across C$155bn ($107bn) worth of US products.\nMexico’s president Claudia Sheinbaum also ordered retaliatory tariffs in response to the US announcement. Sheinbaum said her government sought dialogue rather than confrontation with the US, but that Mexico had been forced to respond in kind. Mexico has been preparing possible retaliatory tariffs on US imports, ranging from 5% to 20%, on pork, cheese, fresh produce, manufactured steel and aluminum, according to reports.\nChina said it would challenge Trump’s 10% tariffs at the World Trade Organization and take unspecified countermeasures. China’s commerce ministry said the imposition of tariffs by the US “seriously violates” WTO rules, urging the US to “engage in frank dialogue and strengthen cooperation”.\nElon Musk’s “department of government efficiency” (Doge) has been given access to the federal payment system, exposing the sensitive personal data of millions of Americans as well as details of public contractors who compete directly with Musk’s own businesses, Ron Wyden, a Democratic senator from Oregon, said.\nSecretary of state Marco Rubio told Panama’s president, José Raúl Mulino, that Trump has determined that China’s influence threatens the Panama Canal and that immediate changes were needed or the Trump administration would take “measures necessary” to do so. Mulino, in response, said Panama’s sovereignty is “not in question”.\nThe Trump administration has revoked temporary protected status (TPS) for more than 300,000 Venezuelans in the US, the New York Times reports. The federal TPS program allows for people to temporarily stay in the US if they cannot return safely to their home country. The termination means that those under TPS from Venezuela who received the protections in 2023 will lose their temporary status 60 days after the government publishes the termination notice, according to the Times.\nDozens more staff at the US Agency for International Development (USAid) were put on leave over the weekend, according to a report, bringing the total number of senior staff at the aid agency who have been put on leave over the past week close to 100. Meanwhile, two senior USAid security officials were also put on administrative leave after refusing to hand over classified documents to Musk’s “department of government efficiency” (Doge).\nThe UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, said he wanted to see “strong trading relations” with the US. Britain’s home secretary, Yvette Cooper, warned that Trump’s tariff plans could have a “really damaging impact” on the global economy and growth.\nIn an effort to restrict abortion access, Wyoming Republicans authored a bill that could choke access to a host of life-saving medical procedures, from chemotherapy to heart surgery.\nState judge Melissa Owens overturned Wyoming’s abortion bans in November 2024, citing the state’s constitutionally guaranteed right to healthcare. The Republican state senator Cheri Steinmetz and the bill’s eight co-sponsors took issue with the ruling and sought to draw up a definition of healthcare that excludes abortion.\n“The intent of [Senate File] 125 is to do no harm and go back to that Hippocratic oath and look at healthcare through that lens,” Steinmeitz said.\nSteinmetz says Senate File 125 offers a new definition of healthcare in Wyoming: “No act, treatment or procedure that causes harm to the heart, respiratory system, central nervous system, brain, skeletal system, jointed or muscled appendages or organ function shall be construed as healthcare.”\nThe bill carves out exceptions – for example, when such a procedure is required to save the life of a pregnant woman, or if “a person has no chance of meaningful recovery” without it. Fetal personhood is still on the books in Wyoming from 2023’s overturned “Life Is a Human Right Act”, but experts interviewed said that the murkiness of the bill’s language made it unclear if it would succeed at restricting abortion access – its intended purpose.\nRead the full story here:\nMeta’s chief executive, the tech billionaire Mark Zuckerberg, has grown increasingly close to Donald Trump since he won the 2024 election, including visiting him at Mar-a-Lago and celebrating with him at his inauguration.\nMeanwhile, media personalities associated with some high-profile criticism of Trump or his Republican allies have started to leave the scene, including NBC’s former Meet the Press host Chuck Todd and CNN’s Jim Acosta, who was one of the most famous Trump-critical journalists on American television but who left his network after his show was shunted to a midnight slot.\n“He’s dictating the news on his terms,” said Michael LaRosa, spokesperson for the former first lady Jill Biden. “He’s become America’s assignment editor.”\nOther examples that have roiled American media are racking up. The Washington Post, owned by Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos, endorsed Trump’s pick for attorney general, election denier Pam Bondi, calling her “qualified” and “serious”. Before the election, it killed an endorsement of Kamala Harris. At the same time, Amazon recently paid the first lady, Melania Trump, a staggering $40m for the rights to a documentary about her life.\nMeanwhile, at the Los Angeles Times, the billionaire owner Patrick Soon-Shiong recently killed an editorial criticizing Trump’s cabinet picks and has granted significant editorial influence to Trump cheerleader Scott Jennings.\nIn a tumultuous first two weeks back in power in the White House, Donald Trump has targeted many familiar enemies, including one of his most passionate obsessions: the US media, whom he has frequently dubbed “enemies of the people”.\nTrump’s new federal communications chair, Brendan Carr, is reported to have ordered an investigation into the sponsorship practices of taxpayer-supported NPR and PBS member stations – a media network long hated by conservatives who accuse it of a liberal slant.\nAt the same time, and just as concerning for some media watchers, core segments of the US media landscape – via the wealthy billionaires and gigantic corporations that own them – have seemingly caved under Trump’s pressure or apparently sought to curry favor with the new administration.\nOn Thursday, the New York Times reported that CBS News parent Paramount is in talks to settle a $10bn claim that it deceptively edited a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris. Paramount is currently concluding an asset sale of its Hollywood studio business.\nThe news of Paramount’s decision – which has reportedly caused deep upset in the CBS newsroom – comes after ABC News agreed to pay $15m to Trump to settle a defamation lawsuit over inaccurate comments by anchor George Stephanopoulos that Trump had been found civilly liable for rape.\nIt also follows the move by social media giant Meta to pay $25m to settle a first amendment protections claim for “impermissible censorship” when it bounced Trump from Facebook and Instagram in 2021. About $22m of that fee will be a donation to Trump’s presidential library.\nClaudia Sheinbaum, Mexico’s president, said her government will provide more details on the retaliatory tariffs she ordered on US goods on Monday.\nSheinbaum, in a statement on Sunday, she will announce details on her government’s “Plan B” as she insisted that Mexico “doesn’t want confrontation”.\n“Problems are not addressed by imposing tariffs, but with talks and dialogue,” she said.\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is seeking to withdraw all papers involving its researchers that are being considered for publication by external scientific journals to allow for a review by the Trump administration, Reuters reports.\nThe review is aimed at removing language to comply with Donald Trump’s executive order saying the federal government will only recognize two sexes, male and female.\nInside Medicine published a list of specific words targeted for removal in the communications review, including gender, transgender, LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) and non-binary.\nPublic health experts said the removal of such terms threatens their ability to address all kinds of medical needs as they affect different groups, including those with HIV and sexually transmitted diseases.\nCarl Schmid, an advocate and executive director of the HIV+ Hepatitis Policy Institute, said:\nWe can’t just erase or ignore certain populations when it comes to preventing, treating or researching infectious diseases such as HIV. I certainly hope this is not the intent of these orders.\nOn Friday, the CDC and other US health agencies took down web pages on HIV statistics and a database tracking behaviors that increase health risks for youth, among other information, to comply with Trump administration orders.\nCanada’s department of finance has published a list of Americans products imported into Canada that it will target with a 25% retaliatory tariff starting Ton uesday.\nThe move comes in response to Donald Trump’s executive order on Saturday imposing a blanket 25% tariff on all Canadian goods imported into the US and 10% levies on Canadian energy.\nThe list shows products that will be hit in the first round of retaliatory tariffs by Canada starting Tuesday, and mounts to 30bn Canadian dollars’ worth of goods (about $20bn).\nThe impacted products include tobacco, produce, household appliances, firearms and military gear.\nCanada is also preparing for a second, broader round of retaliatory tariffs in 21 days that will target another $86bn worth of US imports.\nIsrael’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he will discuss “victory over Hamas”, countering Iran and expanding diplomatic relations with Arab countries in his meeting with Donald Trump on Tuesday.\nNetanyahu said he and Trump would discuss “victory over Hamas, achieving the release of all our hostages and dealing with the Iranian terror axis in all its components, Associated Press reports.\nThe two leaders could “strengthen security, broaden the circle of peace and achieve a remarkable era of peace through strength,” he added.\nPanama’s president, José Raúl Mulino, insisted on the sovereignty of the Panama canal after meeting with the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio.\n“There is no question that the canal is operated by Panama and will continue to be so,” Mulino said.\n“I don’t think there was any discrepancy on that.\n“Panama’s sovereignty is not in question,” he added.\nThe US secretary of state, Marco Rubio told Panama’s president, José Raúl Mulino, in talks on Sunday that Donald Trump has determined that China’s influence threatens the Panama canal and that immediate changes were needed or the Trump administration would take “measures necessary” to do so.\nThe state department, in a summary of the meeting, said Rubio had informed Mulino that Trump believed the current situation at the canal was “unacceptable and that absent immediate changes, it would require the United States to take measures necessary to protect its rights” under a US treaty with Panama.\nA senior Canadian government official said US tariffs violate the obligations of its free trade agreement with Canada, Reuters reports.\nCanada will pursue legal recourse and is preparing countermeasures to blunt the economic impact of the tariffs, the official said.'], 'https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/jan/30/like-dropping-a-bomb-why-is-clean-energy-leader-uruguay-ramping-up-the-search-for-oil': ['‘Like dropping a bomb’: why is clean energy leader Uruguay ramping up the search for oil?', 'The South American country has begun exploration in its Atlantic waters, with experts warning it is endangering livelihoods, marine life and climate goals\nWhen he hears the news, the only words that fisher Francisco Méndez can use are those of war. “What they are planning to do is like dropping a bomb – and when you drop the bomb, everything dies,” says the 41-year-old father of five.\nFor 22 years, Méndez has sailed into the Atlantic Ocean, fishing for brotula and striped weakfish alongside his father, brothers and uncles. He is also joined, occasionally, by dolphins and whales, curious about his white and orange vessel. But now Méndez fears his family’s way of life and livelihood are under threat.\nRenowned for its green energy credentials that see it generating up to 98% of its electricity from renewables, Uruguay is changing tack and ramping up its search for oil in its territorial waters.\nUruguay’s new “black gold” rush has its roots in development more than 7,000km (4,300 miles) away. While the South American country has never found oil on or offshore, its former neighbour Namibia – from when the continents were joined as part of Pangaea – recently did.\nIn 2022, the south-west African country discovered 11bn barrels of oil off its coast, raising the possibility of similar reserves in Uruguay and leading to a stampede of international oil companies descending on Montevideo.\n“We have a very similar geology, very similar spaces,” says Santiago Ferro Castelli, energy transition manager at state-owned energy company Ancap, which is overseeing the exploration.\nSeven contracts have been awarded to some of the biggest energy companies in the world to begin oil and gas prospecting. Seismic data acquisition is expected to begin this year, and drilling will begin in 2026. This marks the first time all 120,000 sq km (46,000 sq miles) of Uruguay’s offshore acreage is under active contracts.\nAncap estimates there is a 3 to 23% probability that areas off its coast will contain oil or gas, and says as much as 30bn barrels could be found.\nUruguay’s late entry into the oil game comes amid a greater race across Latin America and the Caribbean. As the Guardian reported last year, about half of the region’s countries are involved in about 50 major new oil and gas projects. Production is expected to outstrip demand, adding 2m barrels a day destined for export by 2030.\nThe push comes despite the global drive to achieve net zero and a warning from the International Energy Agency that exploration and development of new oil and gas fields must end immediately if the world wants to stay within the safe limits of the climate crisis.\nNot all of those in Uruguay’s government are positive about the plans. Gerardo Amarilla, undersecretary at the environment ministry, believes his country’s exploration is a “complete contradiction of climate change goals”. “It is inconsistent to continue searching for oil or diesel at a time when the world is making a commitment to abandon fossil fuels,” he says.\nOne Uruguayan academic, who wishes to remain anonymous, says that while countries in the global north can argue they “did not know” about subsequent climate effects when they produced emissions for centuries, countries exploiting today “cannot claim the same ignorance”.\nOn the shores of Uruguay, fears are also mounting about what the plans could mean for marine life.\nThe seismic acquisition involves air guns firing into the sea from large vessels every four to 10 seconds, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, until surveys are completed. The blasts create loud sound waves that can penetrate more than 10km beneath the seafloor and, in the open ocean, be detected thousands of kilometres from the source.\nCompanies use the results to produce detailed 3D maps, allowing them to define targets for exploratory wells and tap potential reserves if hydrocarbons are discovered.\nEnvironmental researchers say the process is dangerous for marine species and can lead to habitat abandonment, the disruption of mating and feeding, and beach strandings. It can also damage animals’ hearing and communication ability, cause the displacement of fish populations, and kill large numbers of zooplankton, a crucial marine food resource.\n“It will affect all forms of marine life, from the smallest creatures to our whales,” says Andrés Milessi, a marine biologist of 30 years and director of Mar Azul, a project of the non-governmental organisation Che Wirapitá. Uruguayan waters are rich in biodiversity and home to a great number of creatures, including sperm whales, sea turtles, dolphins and seals.\nSign up to Global Dispatch\nGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development team\nafter newsletter promotion\nAmarilla says the area is of vital importance to flora and fauna, and that during prospecting in the 2010s, several dead whales washed up on the beaches. “We were never able to prove it was the seismic activity that killed the whales, but is it a coincidence that they died? It has not happened since they stopped,” he says.\nIt was also during this earlier testing that fishers reported a huge drop in catch. “Our catches dropped 42% in the year after,” says Juan Riva-Zucchelli, the director of the Chamber of Fisheries.\nMéndez says new seismic exploration and drilling plans will be a “nail in the coffin” for the area’s abundant marine life and artisanal fishing communities, which also suffer from illegal fishing. The fisher recalls that, during this period, he constantly had to find new areas to fish, five to 10 nautical miles away from his usual spot.\n“It was terrible for us,” he says. “To be in the sea, to be in nature, is everything. If they go ahead, the fish will die, and those that don’t die will leave. My whole family are fishers. It will kill all our livelihoods.”\nUruguayans also fear their country entering uncharted territory and question their preparedness if oil is found.\n“Uruguay has no history in hydrocarbon exploitation. So, obviously, we don’t have legislation or laws either,” says Milessi, adding that during previous explorations companies “took advantage”, complying with only “the minimum requirements”.\nAnother point of contention is Uruguay’s position as a leader in clean energy. The country has essentially accomplished the transition other nations are striving for.\nMore than 90% of Uruguay’s energy needs are met by low-carbon sources, and the country exports its surplus energy to neighbouring Brazil and Argentina. Uruguay has also been working toward its long-term green hydrogen goals.\n“Our people have not chosen to be an extractivist country. There wasn’t the opportunity to vote,” says Milessi, who believes Uruguay would benefit more from protecting the ocean and prioritising a blue agenda.\nAncap argues that, even though Uruguay is not reliant on fossil fuels, other countries are, so finding oil and gas could boost the economy. “Finding them could be a source of income, and that could be important for the country,” says Ferro.\nSuch an offer would not go unheeded. Despite being one of the wealthiest countries in Latin America, Uruguay, with a population of 3.4 million, faces problems with the cost of living, education and poverty.\nAbout half of children finish higher secondary school, and one in five children and adolescents live in poverty. Uruguay’s prison system is in crisis, with the 13th-highest prison population in the world.\n“People here still believe climate change is a problem for the future,” says the academic. “For now, the government is trying to keep quiet about the oil exploration – most people don’t even know about it. But if they discover the oil, then they will promote it, saying the money will be used for education and hospitals. It’s like putting a cake in the entrance of a school and telling the children you can’t eat it.”\nThe environment ministry is conducting a study on the environmental impacts and will arrange a public hearing once it has concluded. It adds that companies must meet strict requirements if prospecting begins.\nPablo Gristo, head of exploration and production at Ancap, says the company is adopting the “most stringent guidelines and protocols” regarding oil exploration and remains “fully on board” with promoting energy transition projects.\nThe local fishers, however, who say they have not yet been informed about the proposals, fear their prospects are bleak.\n“The artisanal fisher is disappearing; we are already in the extinction zone,” says Pablo Acosta, a third-generation fisher in La Paloma, a small coastal town. “The businessmen have already stripped the land of the animals. And now they are going to strip the sea.”'], 'https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree': ['Opinion', ''], 'https://www.theguardian.com/global-development': ['Global development', 'Supported by'], 'https://www.theguardian.com/help/contact-us': ['How to contact the Guardian and Observer', 'How to contact people and departments at the Guardian, Observer and the Guardian website.\nAll customer service queries must go through customer service to ensure that we can respond to you, see below for Customer Service details.\nCouldn’t find what you were looking for?\nClick here to access our Help site\nFor any queries including subscription related queries, please visit our Help centre, where you will also find contact details for your region.\nYou can find Customer Service contact details on our Help Centre.\nPlease take care to send queries to the correct destination as there is no guarantee that messages will be forwarded.\nContact the Guardian securely\nFor information on how to contact Guardian journalists securely please read this guide.

Meanwhile, advocates are pushing for states to meet their ambitious climate goals using methods and technologies that don’t require federal support.\n“Our states, cities, businesses, and local institutions stand ready to pick up the baton of US climate leadership and do all they can – despite federal complacency – to continue the shift to a clean energy economy,” Gina McCarthy, former climate adviser to Biden and co-chair of the America Is All In coalition of climate-concerned states and cities, said this month.\nAmong the most promising activity: the creation of a fund to take Trump to court, the passage of policies to make oil companies pay for climate damages, and the continual buildout of already-permitted wind power.\n“The state is not helpless against the president’s assault on the environment,” said Devin Callahan, communications director at the New York League of Conservation Voters. “We need our leaders to recognize the gravity of this moment.”\nHow it’s leading: Weeks after Trump’s election, the state’s governor, Kathy Hochul, signed several major climate bills into law. One will force big oil and gas producers to help pay for climate effects to which their emissions have contributed for the next 25 years, similar to a measure Vermont passed months before.\nAnother new law will ensure schools are built far from from highly polluting roadways, and a third will expand the state’s 10-year-old fracking ban to outlaw the process of injecting liquified carbon dioxide to pull gas from the ground. Days after Trump’s election, Hochul also abruptly resurrected a plan to enact a toll for driving in congested zones, and this month pledged to allocate $1bn to greening the economy.\nIn response to Trump exiting the US from the Paris climate accords for the second time, Hochul also led a group of two dozen governors, representing nearly 55% of the US population, redoubling commitments to slash planet-warming pollution: “Our states and territories continue to have broad authority under the US constitution to protect our progress and advance the climate solutions we need,” Hochul wrote.\nDuring Trump’s first term, New York also signed an ambitious 2019 mandate to obtain 70% of its electricity from renewable energy by 2030. Now, officials have a major opportunity to ensure that goal is met – even under Trump.\nWhat to watch: Despite climate progress in other areas, Hochul has recently disappointed climate advocates by delaying two state climate programs to place a price on carbon emissions, and to gradually transition homes away from gas-powered heat.\nBoth measures would help reduce emissions and lower energy costs – and neither can be derailed by Trump, said Callahan of New York League of Conservation Voters. Hochul could recommit to both, he said.\nTrump’s assault on climate policy also need not necessarily stop the clean energy transition. In fact, a 2023 policy makes New York poised to be a wind and solar leader.\nThat year, amid concern that New York was not on track with its climate targets, New York enabled a state agency, the New York Power Authority (NYPA), to build carbon-free power. Since it is well-resourced, it can do so without the federal incentives that Trump is scrapping, advocates say. The agency also owns land where clean energy infrastructure could be built, which could make it more resilient to permitting restrictions, said Sarahana Shrestha, a socialist state assembly member.\n“NYPA is well-suited to insulate New York from the Trump administration when it comes to our climate goals,” she said.\nAdvocates have long said the NYPA should bring enough renewable energy online to enable New York to reach its goal of 70% renewable power by the decade’s end. But this week, the authority said it would build just one-fifth of that capacity, infuriating advocates.\nThe NYPA’s CEO also said the agency should not be required to lead the energy transition. Advocates are now calling on Hochul to fire the NYPA head and work to put the state back on track with its clean energy mandate.\nHow it’s leading: California is often seen as a leader of the anti-Trump resistance, and with good reason. Just two days after Trump’s November re-election, California lawmakers held a special session to begin preparing to defend its progressive policies from his administration.\nNow, state lawmakers are working to put money toward that cause. The California governor, Gavin Newsom, and Democratic legislative leaders are planning to allocate $50m in state money to fund the legal costs of fighting against Trump’s administration.\xa0The state sued federal officials 123 times between 2017 and 2021, according to a CalMatters analysis of state data.\nTrump has already taken aim at California this month, threatening to withhold disaster aid from the state amid devastating wildfires and falsely claiming in a social media post that the US military intervened to ensure water was used to fight the flames.\nThe president has also sowed chaos within California’s electric vehicle economy, signing orders to freeze charging infrastructure funding and abandon Biden’s ambitious vehicle decarbonization goals. In another order, Trump’s White House also said it would seek to “terminate” state emissions waivers “that function to limit sales of gasoline-powered automobiles”.\nIt took aim at special permission California received in December to enact regulations forcing automakers to sell only carbon-free new vehicles in the state by 2035. But state lawmakers have pledged to fight back.\nWhat to watch: It remains to be seen how many of California’s legal challenges against the Trump administration will successfully overturn policy. Trump lost more than two-thirds of the lawsuits filed against his administration – a lower rate than that of the three administrations prior, according to one New York University analysis.\nIn the meantime, Newsom appears to be taking a different approach to his relationship with Trump. While he took a more combative tack during the president’s first term, last week Newsom met him in Los Angeles and thanked him for his visit.\nAs they watch the Newsom-Trump fight over climate policy play out, California environmentalists are also working to pass stronger climate policies. Many, for instance, are calling on the state to pass its own measure forcing fossil fuel companies to help pay for climate damages. In the past week, more than 40,000 people signed a petition supporting the bill.\nHow it’s leading: During Trump’s first term, environmentalists and labor leaders in Rhode Island worked together to push for an ambitious bill requiring that by 2033, the state must procure 100% of its energy from renewable energy. It passed just three months after Trump left office.\nThe following year, officials passed a law mandating the state bring 1,000 megawatts of wind power online by 2027, and another one in 2022 requiring strong labor standards for all new renewable energy.\nAs Trump asserts that fossil-fuel expansion benefits American workers, Rhode Island has demonstrated that renewables can create good jobs, said Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO. This could make it easier for organizers to build support for clean power, even among conservatives.\n“This is domestically sourced energy, so we don’t have to rely on foreign sources of oil or gas that mean we’re subject to price instability when Russia invades Ukraine,” Crowley said. “And we’re showing people it creates good jobs here in the United States, so even from a conservative’s point of view, offshore wind can be a win-win.”\nWhat to watch: Trump may not derail all progress on renewables – for now. Though he has hit the pause button on new offshore wind leasing, the impacts in Rhode Island and the rest of New England could be limited, because it does not require fully permitted projects to come to a halt.\n“We have a dozen fully permitted projects in New England,” said Crowley. “Those ones look like they’re going to be fine.”\nMore attacks on offshore wind could be on the way from federal officials, which could potentially further imperil those permitted wind projects. But even if they do, officials could keep working on measures that don’t require Trump’s approval, Crowley said.\nThe Rhode Island governor, Dan McKee, for instance, included a measure to reduce carbon emissions from buildings in his budget proposal for 2025 – something climate advocates have demanded for years and are hoping is finalized.\n“Building decarbonization doesn’t need federal money or approval,” Crowley said.\nAnother area where progress may continue: geothermal energy. The carbon-free power source may be less susceptible to Trump’s policies than wind or solar, experts say.\nThis year, advocates hope to pass a bill boosting the carbon-free power source, and to begin constructing pilot projects.\n“That’s a state-based initiative and it doesn’t need federal support,” said Crowley.\nHow they’re leading: It’s not just Democratic states that can continue pushing for climate progress under Trump. Red states will also be integral.\nBiden’s signature climate policy, the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), provided record-breaking incentives in tax credits for companies to build wind, solar and other carbon-free technologies, as well as other climate-focused programs.\nNo Republicans on Capitol Hill voted for the bill. However, red districts benefited most from those monies, receiving 85% of the investment from the policy and 68% of the jobs created. As a result, many saw huge expansions of wind, solar and other green industries.\nTrump last week froze the distribution of unspent IRA funds. But Republican states aren’t giving up without a fight.\nWhat to watch: Last week, at least eight Republicans gave testimony calling on the federal government not to slash IRA tax credits. Speaking before the House ways and means committee, they explained that the law has created economic opportunity in their districts.\nIn August, 18 House Republicans also implored Mike Johnson, the speaker, to preserve the incentives. “Energy tax credits have spurred innovation, incentivized investment, and created good jobs in many parts of the country – including many districts represented by members of our conference,” they wrote in a letter.\nAnd it’s not only politicians who are working to preserve the credits. In the swing state of Wisconsin, which has a Republican-led legislature and Democratic governor and has seen millions of dollars in investment from the IRA, rank-and-file union members are writing letters in defense of the credits.\n“Our members who work on these projects are the best ones to explain what these projects mean to them,” said Kent Miller, president of the Wisconsin Laborers’ District Council.\nIRA incentives led Wisconsin’s four largest investor-owned utilities to commit last year to building out clean energy with unionized labor – progress workers don’t want to see derailed.\n“In some cases … because of these projects, they were able to buy their first home, or they were able to save enough to put their kid through college,” Miller said. “That needs to be heard.”'], 'https://manage.theguardian.com/help-centre': 'Error: Could not find an article title', 'https://www.theguardian.com/sport/golf': ['Golf', ''], 'https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/02/trump-tariffs-mexico-canada-china-retaliation': ['Trump tariffs spark retaliation from Mexico, China and Canada', 'Mexico and Canada vow levies and to ‘enhance relations’ with each other as China and Canada seek legal challenges\nDonald Trump’s imposed tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China have sparked retaliation from all three countries. Mexico and Canada have vowed levies of their own while China and Canada are seeking legal challenges.\nCanada’s department of finance has published a list of US products imported into Canada that it will target with a 25% retaliatory tariff starting on Tuesday.\nThe list shows products that will be hit in the first round of retaliatory tariffs by Canada starting on Tuesday, and mounts to $30bn Canadian dollars’ worth of goods (about US$20bn). The impacted products include tobacco, produce, household appliances, firearms and military gear.\nCanada is also preparing for a second, broader round of retaliatory tariffs in 21 days that will target an additional C$125bn (US$86bn) worth of US imports. The second list would include passenger vehicles, trucks, steel and aluminum products, certain fruits and vegetables, beef, pork, dairy products and more.\nClaudia Sheinbaum, Mexico’s president, said her government will provide more details on the retaliatory tariffs she ordered on US goods on Monday.\nSheinbaum, in a statement on Sunday, she will announce details on her government’s “plan B” as she insisted that Mexico “doesn’t want confrontation”.\n“Problems are not addressed by imposing tariffs, but with talks and dialogue,” she said. “Sovereignty is not negotiable: coordination yes, subordination no.”\nSheinbaum and Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau spoke by phone on Saturday after Trump’s administration imposed the new tariffs – 25% on goods from Canada and Mexico, with a lower rate of 10% for Canadian oil, and 10% on imports from China.\nTrudeau’s office said in a statement that Canada and Mexico agreed “to enhance the strong bilateral relations” between their countries. Canadian officials have had extensive dialogue with their Mexican counterparts, but a senior Canadian official said he would not go as far as to say the tariff responses were coordinated.\n“Now is the time to choose products made right here in Canada,” Trudeau posted Sunday on X. “Check the labels. Let’s do our part. Wherever we can, choose Canada.”\nCanada hopes the tariffs will not take effect on Tuesday, but the Canadian public expects their government to stand firm in a trade dispute with Washington, the Canadian ambassador has said.\n“I think the Canadian people are going to expect that our government stands firm and stands up for itself,” Ambassador Kirsten Hillman told ABC News.\n“We’re certainly not looking to escalate, but we will stand up for Canada,” Trudeau said late on Saturday.\nHowever on Sunday evening, a senior government official from Canada briefing reporters in Ottowa on condition of anonymity said: “We will obviously pursue the legal recourse that we believe we have through the agreements that we share with the United States.”\nThe official said the Canadian government considered the move by Trump illegal and said it violates the trade commitments between the two countries under their free trade agreement and under the World Trade Organization.\n“If other legal avenues are available to us, they will be considered as well,” the official said.\nCanada is the largest export market for 36 states, and Mexico is the largest trading partner of the US.\nCanada and Mexico ordered the tariffs despite Trump’s further threat to increase the duties charged if retaliatory levies are placed on US goods.\nSign up to This Week in Trumpland\nA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration\nafter newsletter promotion\nChina also said it would file a lawsuit against the tariffs. The imposition of tariffs by the US “seriously violates” World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, China’s commerce ministry said in a statement, urging the US to “engage in frank dialogue and strengthen cooperation”.\nFiling a lawsuit with the WTO would be a largely symbolic move that Beijing has also taken against tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles by the EU.\nThe commerce ministry also said the tariffs were “not only unhelpful in solving the US’s own problems, but also undermine normal economic and trade cooperation”. China has said it would take countermeasures to “safeguard its own rights and interests”. It is not clear exactly what form these will take yet. But for weeks Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning has said Beijing believes there is no winner in a trade war.\nLate Sunday night, Trump said that he would speak with Trudeau on Monday morning and shortly after said he would speak with Mexico as well, although he did not specify that he would speak with Sheinbaum.\nBeyond the official response, people were already thinking of ways to cope with Trump’s decision, including by sharing suggestions on social media for alternatives to US products.\nCanadian hockey fans booed the US national anthem on Saturday night at two National Hockey League games. The booing continued on Sunday at an NBA game in Toronto where the Raptors played the Los Angeles Clippers.\nOne fan at the Raptors game chose to sit during the anthem while wearing a Canada hat. Joseph Chua, who works as an importer, said he expects to feel the tariffs “pretty directly”.\n“I’ve always stood during both anthems. I’ve taken my hat off to show respect to the American national anthem, but today we’re feeling a little bitter about things,” he said, adding that he will start to avoid buying US products.\nIn Mexico, public statements on the tariff threat have been limited to saying the government is prepared and that it will ensure the country is respected.\nIn the streets, Mexicans were trying to absorb the announcement on Sunday, although some in the capital acknowledged that they were unaware of the measures.\nIn the border city of Mexicali, across from Calexico, California, some people were concerned about the wider implications of a trade war.\nDriver Alejandro Acosta says that he crosses the border weekly in his truck to deliver vegetables to US companies. He said he fears US businesses in the Mexicali Valley will no longer want to operate in Mexico and they will move to the US.\n“If they raise taxes on the factories here, jobs may also decrease,” he said.'], 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/tabs-popular-1': 'Error: Could not fetch page: 404 Client Error: Not Found for url: https://www.theguardian.com/environment/tabs-popular-1', 'https://www.theguardian.com/index/contributors': ['Columnists', ''], 'https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/men': ['Men', ''], 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news': ['UK latest news', ''], 'https://www.theguardian.com/football': ['Football Weekly', "Sign up for Football Daily\nKick off your afternoons with the Guardian's take on the world of football\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Many local councils have supported the policy of burning waste, which is cheaper than sending it to landfill.\nBut the government is now set to impose pollution charges on the sector under the UK emissions trading scheme (ETS). The cost to councils could be more than £1bn a year.\nA significant chunk of the waste that many householders carefully sort for recycling ends up being burned.\nCouncils now face the prospect of millions of pounds of pollution charges for burning waste. The energy-from-waste incinerators have been described as the dirtiest way the UK now generates power, with campaigners warning that plants in England emit about 12m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year.\nEngland is already burning about half its waste. Environmental groups say councils should focus on encouraging more recycling and a “circular economy”.\nShlomo Dowen, from the UK Without Incineration Network, said the UK’s network of incinerators had undermined recycling efforts and contributed to carbon emissions.\nHe said: “Operators have been given a free ride for far too long on damage caused to the climate by waste incineration.” He said too many councils had entered into contracts with the operators of incinerators that were “bad for the environment and bad for council tax payers”. He said new fiscal measures should also be brought in to ensure higher rates of recycling.\nUnder the proposals to extend the ETS to incinerators, there will be a reporting and verification period from 2026, with the scheme due to start in 2028. The government consulted on the extended scheme in the summer and has made clear it will go ahead.\nA response to the government proposals by waste and bioenergy experts Tolvik Consulting warns new waste incineration fees under the scheme “will exceed the cost of landfill and probably the cost of exports” – it would cost in the range of £135 to £193 a tonne to burn rubbish, compared with £146 to £156 a tonne to send it to landfill, or £111 to £124 a tonne to send it overseas. Tolvik’s response warns of a “significant risk” that more waste would be sent to landfill in England or exported for burning in European plants, with increased road and sea transport emissions. It proposes a ban on sending any waste to landfill that is bio\xaddegradable or combustible in an energy plant.\nChris Jonas at Tolvik Consulting said: “Real care is needed to ensure the incentives for reducing emissions do not lead to worse environmental outcomes, such as more residual waste being sent to landfill sites or an increase in illegal disposal activity. If this happens, then a well-intended policy will have failed very badly indeed.”\nCouncils have already warned the new tax could load billions of pounds of extra costs on local authorities. The Local Government Association said in September that costs faced by councils could rise to £1.1bn a year by 2036. The operators of the incinerators will pay the new tax, but will recoup the costs from additional fees for burning rubbish, which will fall on the councils.\nSign up to Observed\nAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers\nafter newsletter promotion\nMinisters have said that too much waste is burned or sent to landfill, with recycling rates stalled in England. The government published a note in December on waste infrastructure and stated it would only back new projects if they met strict local and environmental conditions.\nA government spokesperson said: “We are reducing waste by moving to a circular economy and will pursue near elimination of biodegradable waste from landfill to support net zero, by ‘turning off the tap’ of future methane emissions.\n“Expanding the UK emissions trading scheme to include energy from waste facilities will cut emissions and drive investment in cleaner supply chains. We continue to engage with industry on the details of this scheme, including how costs will be passed through to reflect emissions reductions and recycling efforts, and will provide further updates in due course.”\nThe Environmental Services Association, the trade association for the recycling and waste treatment sector, said it supported the new charges to help the industry reach net zero. It said the new charges should be accompanied by a ban on biodegradable waste to landfill and a “carbon border adjustment mechanism” to ensure the waste will not be sent\xa0overseas."], 'https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio': ['TV & radio', "Sign up for What's On\nGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every Monday\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But he faced some challenges, such as when the Weeknd blasted the Grammys for lack of transparency over their nominations process.\nMason may have been stung, but “I heard him. I felt his conviction,” he said, because “what we all want is an organization dedicated to the wellbeing of all music makers.”\nThis is the part of the show where the recording academy touts itself, but Mason does note some real changes: new advocacy groups for Black, LGBTQ+ and female artists, as well as a younger and more diverse voting base, with 66% new membership. Enough change that even the Weeknd decided to grace the Grammys with his presence again.\nIncluding that video interlude and the Lady Gaga – Bruno Mars tribute, the Grammys have mostly made good on their promise to prioritize wildfire relief and celebrate LA’s resilience. Some commercial breaks have contained segments dedicated to local businesses impacted by the fires, such as a local floral shop destroyed by the Altadena fire near Pasadena which is already rebuilding. And a QR code has frequently appeared on screen linking to a site for wildfire relief donations.\n“I thought what Chappell said there was absolutely beautiful,” said Trevor Noah, transitioning to a very, very serious note on the wildfires. Noah reminded the audience to remember what happened, then introduced a video showing it – charred homes, lost possessions, many tears. Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga follow up with a … very committed rendition of The Mamas & the Papas’ California Dreamin’.\nNo surprise here – Chappell Roan, last year’s breakout star on the festival circuit, is this year’s best new artist.\nWearing a princess hat and carrying a journal, the 26-year-old used her time to call for record labels to provide better wages and healthcare to up-and-coming artists, recalling the time just a few years ago when she was dropped by her label and couldn’t afford healthcare.\n“If my label would have prioritized artists’ health, I could have been provided care by a company I was giving everything to,” she said. “Labels, we got you, but do you got us?” It was a powerful moment that got a standing ovation – full speech forthcoming.\nAnd South London artist Raye brings this new artist medley home with a jazz-inflected, classically showstopping performance. The successful songwriter – who has penned tracks for Charli xcx, John Legend, Rita Ora, Jennifer Lopez, Little Mix, Beyoncé and more – has seemingly cemented her status as a singer in her own right, with a lengthy standing ovation and a nod by Trevor Noah.\nContinuing this genre tour of best new artist nominees, Teddy Swims delivers a soulful rendition of his hit Lose Control before passing the baton to Shaboozey and his country smash Bar Song (Tipsy). The (admittedly loose) interpolation J-Kwon’s 2004 banger Tipsy, which was inescapable last summer, brings everyone including Jennifer Lopez to their feet.\nNext up is Doechii, with a school girl-themed performance of Denial is a River. The newly minted best rap album winner demonstrated some virtuosic rapping – enough to earn a standing ovation from Jay Z, a visible “oh my god!” from Billie Eilish and an enthusiastic cheer from SZA.\nWe’re onto a showcase for the best new artist category – first up is Benson Boone, the 22-year-old singer of Beautiful Things who seems to be making an appeal to women a few decades older, as Heidi Klum and Nikki Glaser assisted his costume reveal. His octave-spanning performance did draw a standing ovation from J Lo …\nWell well well, the Grammys must be pleased to have this collision of superstars, as Taylor Swift presents Beyoncé with the award for best country album.\nBeyoncé, the winning-est Grammy artist of all time, although famously locked out of major awards, seemed genuinely shocked to win for an album made, in part, in response to the treatment she received at the 2016 CMA Awards.\n“Wow, I really was not expecting this,” she said. “I want to thank God that I’m able to still do what I love after so many years.” Now the first Black woman to win a country music Grammy in over 50 years, Beyoncé also thanked “all of the incredible country artists who accepted this album” and her family (Blue is in attendance!).\n“I think sometimes genre is a codeword to keep us in our place as artists,” she added, “and I want to encourage people to do what they are passionate about and stay persistent.”\nOlivia Rodrigo introduces tonight’s third best new artist frontrunner (along with Sabrina Carpenter and Doechii): Chappell Roan, whom Rodrigo knew when Roan was still a struggling artist working at a donut shop in LA’s Highland Park.\nWith a rodeo clown-themed performance that involved, naturally, a jumbo pink pony, the Willard, Missouri, native sang Pink Pony Club – a song she recorded and released in 2021 before getting dropped by her label and working at said donut shop. The song, as she said in a pre-recorded segment, is a “love letter to LA”, a place that “gave me the courage to be myself”.\nEverything is coming up roses for Sabrina Carpenter, who wins best pop vocal album in a stacked category that included Billie Eilish, Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande and fellow best new artist nominee Chappell Roan.\n“I really was not expecting this,” said Carpenter, still out of breath from her performance a few minutes ago. She thanked her mom “for driving me to every voice lesson”, her dad, sisters and all the producers on Short n’ Sweet.\nCarpenter also shouted out LA, as did presenters Chad Smith and Anthony Kiedis of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, who sang an a cappella section of Under the Bridge in tribute to their home city.\nOh wow, a huge win for the women of rap and the up-and-comers: Doechii, the 26-year-old Florida-based rapper also nominated for best new artist, wins best album, as presented by an on-form Cardi B.\n“I don’t want to make this long but this category was introduced in 1989 and two women have won – three women have won! – Lauryn Hill, Cardi B and Doechii,” she said through tears.\nThe “Swamp Princess” thanked her mother, with whom she shared the stage, as well as her hometown of Tampa, Florida. “Whenever people think about Florida, they think about Miami but … there’s so much talent in Tampa,” she said.\nAnd she ended with a triumphant call to Black women: “I’m telling you, you can do it. Anything is possible … you are exactly who you need to be to be right where you are and I am a testimony.”\n2024 was a massive year for the pop girls, and Sabrina Carpenter reminds everyone why. The pint-sized best new artist nominee, one of the breakout stars of the year, brought her pin-up style to the Grammys for a jazzy, characteristically cheeky take on her summer smash Espresso and follow-up Please Please Please with a set inspired by – naturally – Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.\nIt’s fitting for tonight’s theme that the first nominee performance of the evening comes from local legends Billie Eilish and Finneas, the siblings from Highland Park. The duo and a band perform their inescapable hit Birds of a Feather with an LA-based background, which (unsurprisingly) gets Taylor Swift to her feet and ends with a sweet note of “I love you, LA.”\nFollowing Doors, Noah gets right back on the mic to answer everyone’s burning question: is Beyoncé here? Not yet, but maybe soon? “Yes, Beyoncé will be here tonight,” he said. “Well, I hope she’ll be here. I can’t make her do anything.”\nRoving about the crowd, particularly hovering around Taylor Swift and Chappell Roan, Noah took the lightest of digs at the night’s big stars, starting with the biggest. Beyoncé has 11 nominations and just announced her 2025 Cowboy Carter tour: “Beyoncé, there’s tariffs,” said Noah. “We can’t afford a new tour. Maple syrup is about to be $50.”\nNoah joked about the “power of AI”: “maybe one day, we could get another Rihanna album” – and Swift’s Eras Tour. “She got more Americans traveling than those Turkish hair transplants,” he joked.\nAnd he alluded to Trump’s presidency as “changes” in Washington DC. “I’m going to enjoy tonight, because this may be the last time I’m allowed to host anything in this country,” he joked. Well … oof.\nAnd we’re off! Host Trevor Noah kicks things off by acknowledging the elephant in the room: it’s weird to have an award show in LA so close to the devastating wildfires. “This city has just been through one of the largest natural disasters in American history,” he said.\nThanks to heroic firefighters, “the fires have now been contained”, he continued. “And despite all the devastation, the spirit of the city has endured.”\nNoah summarily explained the mission of the evening: celebrate music, yes, but also “the city that brought us so much of that music”. He shouted out the LA inspirations for hometown heroes Billie Eilish and Snoop Dogg, as well as Chappell Roan and Stevie Wonder, before introducing local band Doors, who lost multiple homes and their studio in the fires, for an opening performance with an all-star band including John Legend, Sheryl Crow, St Vincent, Brad Paisley and Brittany Howard. Repeating the mantra “We Love LA,” they bring the crowd to their feet.\nTonight will feature a starry tribute to Quincy Jones who died last November. Here’s a look back to a great tribute from Alexis Petridis:\nIt’s close to show time, so the A-list pop stars are finally here, led by Taylor Swift in a sparkly red mini dress reminiscent of her Eras Tour stage costumes.\nBest new artist nominees making the most of their Grammy moment:'], 'https://www.theguardian.com/tone/cartoons': ['Latest cartoons', ''], 'https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/01/donald-trump-fantasy-politics-reality-conservative#comments': ['In Trump’s fantasy politics, he can accomplish anything – but reality will prevail', 'His second term seems to represent an unassailable victory for conservative white men – but soon he’ll be another incumbent in an anti-incumbent world\nWhy exactly is Donald Trump’s new presidency so disorienting? So far, explanations have tended to focus on its manic pace, contempt for political conventions and blatant subversion of supposedly one of the world’s most robust democracies.\nBut all these elements were also present in his first presidency. Meanwhile, other features of both his terms, such as his cult of personality, scapegoating of immigrants and accusation that liberal elites have caused national decline, are standard practice for hard-right strongmen, and have been for at least a century.\nYet still he baffles and wrongfoots people, both opponents and more neutral observers, political professionals and voters, Americans and foreigners. There is an underexplored reason for this. Trump’s presidency, and particularly his second term, is a deeply paradoxical project. In some ways, it’s an epic political fantasy, a promise that every dream of US reactionaries and nationalists can be rapidly fulfilled. But in other ways, it’s a frightening intrusion of reality – into the rose-tinted picture many liberals still have of how America works and how America relates to the rest of the world.\nThe central assumption of the Trump fantasy is that in his remaining four-year term, during which he will enter his 80s, despite the US’s sharp social divides and inevitable buffeting by global crises, he can accomplish almost anything. “I stand before you now,” he said at his inauguration, “as proof that you should never believe that something is impossible … We stand on the verge of the four greatest years in American history.”\nOther elements of the Trump fantasy include the belief that the US can essentially ignore the climate crisis; that it can impose big tariffs on imports without causing increases in their prices; that Trump’s personal interventions can swiftly and permanently end longstanding conflicts such as Gaza; and that his constant lies, exaggerations and inventions can create new realities, both reshaping the present and permanently rewriting history. In short, the Trump fantasy promises that in an anti-political age his brand of politics can nevertheless solve everything.\nYet at the same time, the opening days of his second term have revealed truths about the US that were previously half hidden. Its alliance with western Europe is not permanent. It is still an imperial power in the traditional sense, with territorial ambitions. And much of corporate America is happy to have an authoritarian government, as long as it is good for profits. “History’s greatest civilization,” as Trump described his country at the inauguration, is really a brutally competitive, aggressively nationalistic place – at least for large stretches – rather than the essentially benign society and superpower believed in for so long by so many liberals. It’s taken Trump’s unfiltered presidency to finally make that obvious.\nMore bewildering still for those who don’t back him, sometimes the fantastical and reality-based strands of Trumpism are closely entangled. His strong support from men and halting of pro-diversity policies, for instance, are partly the products of a fantasy – that under him straight male dominance as it existed decades ago can be restored – and yet they are also a reminder that in the US, as in other democracies, socially conservative men remain a powerful electoral force.\nSimilarly, Trump’s climate policies – however delusional they seem with growing swathes of his country on fire because of extreme weather – are also a recognition that any serious US response to the crisis would require his richer voters and donors to make drastic lifestyle changes. If the planet and the patriarchy are in trouble, as many Trump supporters probably accept, deep down, like everyone else, then there is an argument, albeit a selfish one, for enjoying all the carbon-intensive privileges of traditional American masculinity while you still can. With his love of burgers and gold surfaces, his water-hungry golf courses and multiple homes, Trump’s own life constantly showcases this kind of resource-heavy, escapist consumption. In a world increasingly haunted by scarcity, with supply chains weakened by wars, disruptive weather and the pandemic, his excess is a crude but potent statement.\nFaced again by this combination of reality-denial and self-interest, how might those who oppose Trump at home and abroad, or who run governments that are going have to coexist with his, regain their political composure? One way may simply be to wait for his frenzy of executive orders to lose its political effectiveness, a process that may have already begun with an order freezing federal grants chaotically reversed this week. Even some Trump voters will realise sooner or later that issuing decrees from Washington and ending “America’s decline”, as he promises, are not the same thing.\nAnother useful approach may be to understand the attractiveness for many voters of Trump’s fantasies, but also their impracticality. Despite the claims from Trump and a credulous media that he is a unique American leader, the country has a recent tradition of Republican presidents making unattainable promises. In the 1980s, Ronald Reagan said he would make America safe again, with an unprecedented “Star Wars” anti-missile system, and in the 2000s George W Bush pledged to do the same by invading Iraq. Both projects were disasters. The Iraq war also damaged US allies, especially Britain, partly because Tony Blair’s government saw Bush’s Iraq fixation as too powerful to question. Ominously, Keir Starmer and Trump are already telling us how well they get on.\nAny other non-Republicans tempted to just accept that this is the age of Trump might usefully look to the numbers behind his support. Last year, unlike in 2016, he did win the popular vote, but by only 1.5 percentage points. Yet both pro- and anti-Trump forces act as if he has a mandate so overwhelming that resistance is futile. His party’s majorities in the Senate and the House are also tiny.

Many scientists have tried and failed to reproduce Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons’s initial report of cold fusion. After years of intense scrutiny, the mainstream scientific community overwhelmingly concluded by the early 1990s that cold fusion was not a credible idea supported by experimental evidence – a conclusion that stands after three decades of research.\nThe authors of the letter to the Guardian suggest that cold fusion research is now being suppressed from publication. In reality, credible, rigorous studies continue to be published in reputable journals (such as a 2019 study in Nature), but none of them has successfully observed cold fusion. The letter claims that companies have “been able to make these reactions work quite reliably”, but do not provide any evidence to support this.\nThe climate crisis requires immediate action, but those actions must be based on rigorous, reproducible science.

It would, she said, “significantly increase air and noise pollution”, so on environmental grounds, it should not happen.\nBy the autumn of 2021, as shadow chancellor, Reeves was the senior Labour figure chosen to lead her party’s hugely ambitious plans for a green industrial revolution.\nIt was Labour’s big idea: “going green” – leading the way in new renewable technology – would kill two birds with one stone, creating economic growth for the UK while saving the planet. The words “green” and “growth” sat neatly together.\n“I will be a responsible chancellor. I will be Britain’s first green chancellor,” Reeves told the Labour conference that year. A Labour government would pump £28bn a year into a green energy revolution, creating jobs and prosperity, and ensuring a safe world to live in for future generations.\nLast week, however, in the minds of some increasingly disillusioned figures in her own party, Reeves had surrendered the right to call herself Britain’s first green chancellor barely seven month into her time in office.\nWith Reeves already having watered down the £28bn pledge well before the general election, her announcement on Wednesday backing a third runway at Heathrow – alongside ideas for transforming the area between Oxford and Cambridge into “Europe’s Silicon Valley” – was all about hunting for economic growth.\nBut, it seemed, the environment and climate crisis had been quietly sidelined. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, was appalled. Reports surfaced – and were not denied – that several ministers, including the energy secretary, Ed Miliband, had spoken out at cabinet against the plan because it would run directly contrary to Labour’s supposed green agenda and climate commitments.\nOne senior party figure said: “If we do this, we might as well just forget climate change now.”\nAnother source was fuming: “The green part of the bargain has been dramatically de-emphasised. We no longer talk of the green route to growth. Just growth.”\nAmong environmentalists, the reaction was one of cynicism and weary bemusement more than anger.\n“It was weirdly muted from the green lobby because everyone knows that a third runway at Heathrow is simply never ever going to happen,” said one environmentalist. “The politics are nightmarish, it will take for ever, the first planes would not take off until 2040, it would mean rerouting the M25, which is insane, probably mean us breaching our climate commitments, and it will not create anything like the economic growth she claims.”\nMany Labour people say the Heathrow element of the growth push smacks of desperation. The chancellor herself insists she backed Heathrow expansion in 2017 and that nothing will go ahead it if does not fit with the UK’s international climate crisis commitments. But the worries about her approach are spreading. “The upsides of going ahead with Heathrow are very few, while the downsides are huge – it is just not very good politics,” said a party insider.\nSince the turn of the year, Reeves has been desperate to get the business community back onside after her unpopular budget hit companies with big national insurance rises.\nThe urgent need to boost growth in order to bring in revenue became all the greater in early January when a bout of jitters rocked the bond markets, in turn raising questions about the UK government’s ability to service its debts. “That was the time they got spooked,” said a source. “The Heathrow idea didn’t really come back into view until the beginning of this year – until after the market uncertainty.”\nPerhaps most worrying for Reeves is not the political objections, but the way her justifications for putting Heathrow expansion back on to the agenda have been treated with widespread scorn.\nSign up to Observed\nAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers\nafter newsletter promotion\nAoife O’Leary, chief executive of Opportunity Green, a campaign group, has studied the arguments around sustainable aviation fuel, which Reeves says has become a “gamechanger”, and describes them as “essentially a mirage”.\nShe says: “Yes, these fuels are biofuels made from crops, cooking oils and other sources of plant biomass. But producing them takes up huge amounts of land, endangering food security and biodiversity.\n“Indeed, very little of these fuels even exist today and producing them at anything like the scale that will be needed to decarbonise aviation would be totally incompatible with any notions of sustainability.\n“Purchasing these fuels will send even more money outside the UK as most ‘sustainable’ aviation fuel comes from abroad, with wood pellets from overseas forests imported into the UK just to be burned for jet fuel.”\nIn her speech, Reeves cited the most recent study from the consultancy Frontier Economics as concluding that a third runway at Heathrow “could increase potential GDP by 0.43% by 2050”. It has since been confirmed that the survey in question was commissioned by Heathrow itself and is based on data it supplied.\n“It is very concerning that the chancellor appears to be basing her support for Heathrow expansion on a figure from a report commissioned by Heathrow airport,” said Alex Chapman at the New Economics Foundation. “Even more worrying is the fact that the methodology they have applied is one that the Department for Transport has previously decided is not fit for purpose and that the report uses forecast data supplied by the airport itself.”\nChapman added: “Heathrow expansion represents a major threat to the UK’s climate goals and flies in the face of scientific advice. To ensure that the claimed economic benefits are concrete, assessments should be carried out by independent government economists following best-practice methodology.”\nInside the Treasury, the search for new sources of economic growth widens by the day. It is said to be the exchequer more than No 10 that is pushing an ambitious, bold reset with the EU over post-Brexit trade. Reeves has talked of leaving “no stone unturned”.\nSome close to the chancellor suggest that she is deliberately pushing the boundaries. One said: “In a sense, she has not that much to lose. If these things don’t work, she can at least say she was the one who tried.”"], 'https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters': ['Letters', ''], 'https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/feb/02/marshall-islands-team-vanishing-kit-climate-crisis': ['Marshall Islands’ vanishing kit for a team under threat from climate crisis', 'The isolated Pacific nation is trying to build its first football team amid a battle for survival against rising sea levels\nThe Marshall Islands, an isolated sprawl of atolls covering 750,000 square miles of the Pacific Ocean but home to barely 42,000 people, may be the final frontier for the world’s most popular sport. It claims to be the last country on Earth without a football team, and to this day, the islands have never hosted an 11-a-side game.\nUntil recently, football was an alien concept in a nation occupied by the US since the second world war, with baseball and basketball the traditional sports. As interest has grown in recent years, another barrier has emerged. Land has always been at a premium on these fragile shores, but never more than now with rising sea levels bringing fears of permanent flooding.\nThe ocean around these islands has risen by 3.4mm a year since 1993, more than twice the worldwide average. A total rise of one metre would leave the most populous atolls ravaged by permanent inundations; any more than that, and the Marshall Islands could be wiped from the map. The country’s first full-size football pitch, built for last year’s Micronesian Games, was only approved with the proviso that it would also act as a sea defence on the most populous atoll, Majuro.\nThis remote area of the Pacific has a history marked by environmental atrocities. The Marshall Islands were the site of more than 60 US-led nuclear tests between 1946 and 1958, with over a third taking place on the most infamous atoll, Bikini. Serious health issues that linger from that era, and the fear of a future blighted by floods, have meant the expatriate population has more than doubled since 2010. More Marshallese people now live abroad than at home.\nIn the midst of this precarious situation, the Marshall Islands’ first football federation was set up in 2020 with the aim of growing the game sustainably. A small group of people have been recruited, tasked with building a team, coaching youngsters and promoting the islands’ plight. Many of them, like the commercial director, Matt Webb, and the men’s first-team coach, Lloyd Owers, are based in the UK, 8,000 miles away.\nHaving read an article about the mission to build the first Marshallese football team, Webb contacted the federation president, Shem Levi, to offer his services for free. “He set up the FA because his son was getting into football,” Webb says, adding that Levi initially took some convincing. “In the end, he said: ‘What’s the worst you can do? Go ahead and do your thing.’”\nFor Webb, Owers and others including Katie Smith, recently made the Marshall Islands’ first women’s team coach, that has involved globetrotting to run coaching sessions while working hard to boost the nascent team’s online profile. “How do you get from absolute zero to competing in World Cup qualifiers?” Webb asks. “We don’t get any external funding, so we’ve been reliant on grants, donations and merchandise sales.”\nHaving released a successful home kit in 2023 inspired by the blue and orange Marshallese flag, their latest project is a new “No-Home Jersey”. Decorated with the islands’ unique flora, fauna and cultural emblems, and bearing the number 1.5 – the global temperature rise seen by Pacific nations as a fatal tipping point.\nThe shirt caught fans’ attention when launched online, before something strange started to happen. In each picture posted on social media, scraps of the shirt disappeared in what was a starkly clear message. “Existentially the country faces a huge crisis with climate change,” Webb says. “We wanted to make something which is both a celebration of the country, but also drawing attention to the fact there’s a very real threat.”\nNowhere in the Marshall Islands is safe from the risk of flooding – not even the president’s house – and Webb has seen the effects for himself. “When you’re on the islands, you can see the impact it has on day-to-day life. There are risks from rising tides, storms and flash flooding, and people have to build sea walls outside their homes, to try and protect them.”\nHe recalls the day his group of coaches hoped to put on the islands’ first-ever domestic tournament on Majuro, the “capital” atoll that curves for 25 miles around a central lagoon. “We were hit by an absolute deluge. Even though the pitch was under cover, people couldn’t get there because of flooding. It’s a tropical island, but because the rain is so ferocious it can happen very quickly.”\nMost of Majuro’s population are squeezed into the eastern end, in a conurbation known as Delap-Uliga-Djarrit, or D-U-D. “We’ve been thinking about approaching Rory Delap for sponsorship,” Webb jokes. At other points on the atoll, such as Jenrok, where the new stadium has been built, the land’s entire width could conceivably be crossed by a trademark Delap long throw.\nThe coaching team divide their overseas trips between Majuro and the small town of Springdale, Arkansas. As the headquarters of a poultry producer with connections to the islands, it has become the unlikely centre of Marshallese life beyond the Pacific. Springdale was the location for a four-day women’s futsal – five-a-side indoor football – camp early last year, at which players travelled from Texas and California to try out as international players.\n“We’ve been identifying potential players through word of mouth and searching online,” Webb says. “We’ve paid for people’s travel and accommodation [to Arkansas], just to try and get together and arrange a game.” Keeping in touch with the islands, 12 hours ahead of the UK, also poses problems. “There are a few 3am meetings,” adds Webb, who balances his voluntary role with a job in marketing.\nSometimes, though, the logistical headaches of football in Oceania have played into their hands. “We were going to travel to Kiribati, our closest neighbours, for a futsal match,” he says. “At the last minute, they had to cancel – so we invited another team, Micronesia, to visit us instead. Kiribati decided they didn’t want to miss out, so we ended up accidentally hosting an international football tournament!”\nIt represents a dramatic change for Webb, whose previous football experience came from coaching in schools and at university, and launching his own team with friends that grew from Sunday league level. “There are some interchangeable skills,” he says. “If you can get 11 players to turn up on a wet, cold Sunday morning in Devon, you can do anything.”\nThe newly formed Marshallese federation has been building things slowly – getting football on to the national curriculum, helping senior players get used to playing on grass, and expanding weekly coaching sessions beyond Majuro to a group of about 100 youngsters. Still, the ticking clock triggered by the climate crisis calls for some difficult decisions to be made.\n“International football is expensive,” Webb says. “There is infrastructure in place – the stadium, hotels, an airport – but the lack of regular funding makes expanding further in a sustainable manner a real challenge.” In an effort to move things along, the Marshall Islands have applied to join the Oceania Football Confederation (OFC), where they will probably start as an associate member, without full Fifa recognition.\nWith so many shifting obstacles in their way, Webb and his team have learned to be flexible. Arriving on islands with far more indoor basketball courts than open grass spaces, their coaching focus has shifted to futsal, which is also governed by Fifa. Hosting their first-ever 11-a-side game on grass remains a key ambition. “I want to say [it will happen] this year, but that will be a huge achievement,” he says.\nThere is a Marshallese proverb that says: “Drops together make the ocean, and grains of sand together make an island.” From the onslaught of atomic bombs to a future threatened by rising tides, this is a place that has learned how small victories can add up in the greater battle for survival. Football may not have played any part in the islands’ history, but it could play a crucial role in its future.'], 'https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/01/donald-trump-fantasy-politics-reality-conservative': ['In Trump’s fantasy politics, he can accomplish anything – but reality will prevail', 'His second term seems to represent an unassailable victory for conservative white men – but soon he’ll be another incumbent in an anti-incumbent world\nWhy exactly is Donald Trump’s new presidency so disorienting? So far, explanations have tended to focus on its manic pace, contempt for political conventions and blatant subversion of supposedly one of the world’s most robust democracies.\nBut all these elements were also present in his first presidency. Meanwhile, other features of both his terms, such as his cult of personality, scapegoating of immigrants and accusation that liberal elites have caused national decline, are standard practice for hard-right strongmen, and have been for at least a century.\nYet still he baffles and wrongfoots people, both opponents and more neutral observers, political professionals and voters, Americans and foreigners. There is an underexplored reason for this. Trump’s presidency, and particularly his second term, is a deeply paradoxical project. In some ways, it’s an epic political fantasy, a promise that every dream of US reactionaries and nationalists can be rapidly fulfilled. But in other ways, it’s a frightening intrusion of reality – into the rose-tinted picture many liberals still have of how America works and how America relates to the rest of the world.\nThe central assumption of the Trump fantasy is that in his remaining four-year term, during which he will enter his 80s, despite the US’s sharp social divides and inevitable buffeting by global crises, he can accomplish almost anything. “I stand before you now,” he said at his inauguration, “as proof that you should never believe that something is impossible … We stand on the verge of the four greatest years in American history.”\nOther elements of the Trump fantasy include the belief that the US can essentially ignore the climate crisis; that it can impose big tariffs on imports without causing increases in their prices; that Trump’s personal interventions can swiftly and permanently end longstanding conflicts such as Gaza; and that his constant lies, exaggerations and inventions can create new realities, both reshaping the present and permanently rewriting history. In short, the Trump fantasy promises that in an anti-political age his brand of politics can nevertheless solve everything.\nYet at the same time, the opening days of his second term have revealed truths about the US that were previously half hidden. Its alliance with western Europe is not permanent. It is still an imperial power in the traditional sense, with territorial ambitions. And much of corporate America is happy to have an authoritarian government, as long as it is good for profits. “History’s greatest civilization,” as Trump described his country at the inauguration, is really a brutally competitive, aggressively nationalistic place – at least for large stretches – rather than the essentially benign society and superpower believed in for so long by so many liberals. It’s taken Trump’s unfiltered presidency to finally make that obvious.\nMore bewildering still for those who don’t back him, sometimes the fantastical and reality-based strands of Trumpism are closely entangled. His strong support from men and halting of pro-diversity policies, for instance, are partly the products of a fantasy – that under him straight male dominance as it existed decades ago can be restored – and yet they are also a reminder that in the US, as in other democracies, socially conservative men remain a powerful electoral force.\nSimilarly, Trump’s climate policies – however delusional they seem with growing swathes of his country on fire because of extreme weather – are also a recognition that any serious US response to the crisis would require his richer voters and donors to make drastic lifestyle changes. If the planet and the patriarchy are in trouble, as many Trump supporters probably accept, deep down, like everyone else, then there is an argument, albeit a selfish one, for enjoying all the carbon-intensive privileges of traditional American masculinity while you still can. With his love of burgers and gold surfaces, his water-hungry golf courses and multiple homes, Trump’s own life constantly showcases this kind of resource-heavy, escapist consumption. In a world increasingly haunted by scarcity, with supply chains weakened by wars, disruptive weather and the pandemic, his excess is a crude but potent statement.\nFaced again by this combination of reality-denial and self-interest, how might those who oppose Trump at home and abroad, or who run governments that are going have to coexist with his, regain their political composure? One way may simply be to wait for his frenzy of executive orders to lose its political effectiveness, a process that may have already begun with an order freezing federal grants chaotically reversed this week. Even some Trump voters will realise sooner or later that issuing decrees from Washington and ending “America’s decline”, as he promises, are not the same thing.\nAnother useful approach may be to understand the attractiveness for many voters of Trump’s fantasies, but also their impracticality. Despite the claims from Trump and a credulous media that he is a unique American leader, the country has a recent tradition of Republican presidents making unattainable promises. In the 1980s, Ronald Reagan said he would make America safe again, with an unprecedented “Star Wars” anti-missile system, and in the 2000s George W Bush pledged to do the same by invading Iraq. Both projects were disasters. The Iraq war also damaged US allies, especially Britain, partly because Tony Blair’s government saw Bush’s Iraq fixation as too powerful to question. Ominously, Keir Starmer and Trump are already telling us how well they get on.\nAny other non-Republicans tempted to just accept that this is the age of Trump might usefully look to the numbers behind his support. Last year, unlike in 2016, he did win the popular vote, but by only 1.5 percentage points. Yet both pro- and anti-Trump forces act as if he has a mandate so overwhelming that resistance is futile. His party’s majorities in the Senate and the House are also tiny. If he disappoints only a small fraction of his supporters, neither majority may survive the 2026 midterm elections.\nTrump may seem dizzyingly strong now. Yet soon he will be just another incumbent, in an anti-incumbent world. The problem then, for those who don’t support him, won’t be his dominance of the discourse, which may be slipping, but how much of the American state he controls.\nAndy Beckett is a Guardian columnist'], 'https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-politics': ['US politics', ''], 'https://www.theguardian.com/music': ['Music', ''], 'https://www.theguardian.com/type/video+tone/comment': 'Error: Could not find an article body', 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine': ['Ukraine', ''], 'https://www.theguardian.com/food': ['Food', '2025 has arrived, so why not start the new year discovering new flavours?

So for me, it’s a no-brainer.”\nWisley began as an experimental garden in 1878, with the idea of making “difficult plants grow successfully”. It is now the leading garden of the RHS and is visited by more than one million people a year.\n“A composting loo and the wider Greener Skills Garden really fits in with that original ethos of experimenting and pushing the boundaries of what we do in horticulture,” said George.\nDr Chloe Sutcliffe, an RHS sustainability fellow, said the Greener Skills Gardenwill also include Wisley’s first rain garden, featuring plants that can withstand being waterlogged for days, followed by dry periods.\nThis is part of an experiment to find out how different planting schemes and the overflow from rainwater storage containers, for example, can be designed to manage heavy rainfall across a garden. “We’re encouraging visitors to be able to see the journey that water takes through gardens, so that people can start to understand how gardens can be used to slow the flow of water across the landscape,” Sutcliffe said. “That is something we increasingly need to do to try to increase our resilience to heavy rainfall and reduce the risk of flash flooding in the future.”"], 'https://www.youtube.com/user/TheGuardian': 'Error: Could not find an article title', 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/feb/03/intensely-hot-weather-to-continue-in-south-eastern-australia': ['Heatwave warning as ‘intensely hot’ weather continues in south-eastern Australia', 'BoM forecasts high of 39C in Melbourne and 41C in Adelaide with cool change not expected until Tuesday or Wednesday\nSouth-eastern states sweltering in a heatwave may be waiting until late Tuesday or Wednesday for a cool change to bring some relief.\nMelbourne and Adelaide were in for another very hot day on Monday, after highs of 38C and 39C on Sunday.

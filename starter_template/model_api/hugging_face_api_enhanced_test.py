BFA Secretary General Zhang Jun invited the chief advisor to the government.\nBeijing will also host the economist known for his microcredit endeavours to commemorate 50 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries.\nAnalysts believe India may be upset over the increasing bonhomie between its neighbouring states of Bangladesh and China.\nThe meeting was announced two days after New Delhi raked up the issue of alleged persecution of minorities, including Hindus, in the South Asian country. It raised the issue at a United Nations Human Rights Council session in Geneva and pointed out that a UN fact-finding report team had found that Bangladesh "mainstreamed" the concept of "revenge violence against minorities".\nIndia Accuses Bangladesh Of Minority Persecution\nThe allegation came after hundreds of Hindus were attacked, their homes and temples ransacked and vandalized after Sheikh Hasina fled the country.\nHasina quit the office and fled Bangladesh on August 5, 2024, after thousands of people stormed her official residence, vandalized and ransacked it and looted whatever they could.\nWhen Indian Foreign Minister S Jaishankar met his UK counterpart David Lammy at Chatham House in London on March 5, Bangladesh was one of the subjects the two leaders discussed.\nPolitical analysts and geostrategic experts believe Muhammad Yunus\' China visit may upset New Delhi as it may set the alarm bell ringing.\nWhy Is India Upset Over Bangladesh-China Bonhomie?\nThey point out that Beijing has been pursuing the policy of surrounding India from all sides, particularly in the Indian Ocean with its "String of Pearls" strategy.\nUnder the String of Pearls strategy, Beijing is aggressively developing its bases in the Indian Ocean to augment its geopolitical influence or military existence spreading from Hainan Island to Gwadar Port in the Pakistani province of Balochistan.\nThe significance of this strategy can be gauged by the fact that the Chinese initiative is to create a network of ports and naval bases in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) encircling India. The main ports surrounding India are Gwadar in Pakistan, Hambantota in Sri Lanka and Sittwe in Myanmar, all these are situated in the Bay of Bengal.\nThe growing defence cooperation between China and Bangladesh may also upset India.\nString Of Pearl To Surround India?\nDhaka and Bangladesh signed a landmark Defense Cooperation Agreement in 2002 when Khaleda Zia of Bangladesh Nationalist Party was the prime minister of the country.\nThis cooperation soared after her opponent and presumably pro-India Sheikh Hasina became the head of the state. She launched an ambitious modernisation plan for the Bangladesh Armed Forces in 2009 with the help of Beijing.\nBeijing supplied Ming-class diesel-electric attack submarines, Shadhinota-class C13B corvettes, MBT-2000 Type 90-II and VT-5 light tanks, HQ-7 short-range surface-to-air missiles, and dozens of F-7BGI fighter interceptors to Dhaka. It also allowed Dhaka to build a variety of Chinese small and light weapons.\nWith a change in the government that is allegedly tilted towards anti-India elements like China and Pakistan, it may gain new heights, creating further problems for New Delhi.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa\' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says \'Big Fan\' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress\' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina'], 'https://www.dnaindia.com/health/report-innovative-medical-device-reliability-akshay-gaikwad-s-pythia-tool-implementation-success-3125251': ["Innovative medical device reliability: Akshay Gaikwad's Pythia tool implementation success", "HEALTH\nAkshay Gaikwad led the groundbreaking development of 'Pythia,' a predictive maintenance tool at Outset Medical that has transformed the company's approach to field reliability management.\nMeemansa Shekhawat\nUpdated : Jan 02, 2025, 03:56 PM IST\nAkshay Gaikwad led the groundbreaking development of 'Pythia,' a predictive maintenance tool at Outset Medical that has transformed the company's approach to field reliability management.

Recently, the Alipore Court in Kolkata ruled that Mohammad Shami is required to pay monthly alimony to Hasin Jahan.\nIn 2018, Hasin Jahan filed legal action against Mohammad Shami, requesting a monthly alimony of 10 lakh rupees. She indicated that 7,00,000 rupees were necessary for her personal expenses, while 3,00,000 rupees were intended for their daughter's upkeep.\nAfter a hearing in January 2023, the court decided that Shami would need to pay a monthly maintenance amount of 130,000 rupees, taking into account the arguments presented by both sides.\nFollowing the court's ruling, Hasin Jahan voiced her disappointment, mentioning that the amount awarded did not meet her expectations. She suggested that she might consider appealing the decision in the High Court.\nHasin Jahan's lawyer, Mriganka Mistry, informed the court that Mohammad Shami's annual income for the financial year 2020-21 was over 7 crore rupees. This information was presented to bolster the request for a monthly maintenance allowance of 10 lakh rupees.\nHasin Jahan's net worth\nHasin Jahan has a background in modeling and has previously worked as a cheerleader for the Kolkata Knight Riders during the IPL.

But do you know the story behind the remarkable success of the e-commerce platform?\nWell, let us tell you that it was founded by two IITians - Vidit Aatrey and Sanjeev Barnwal. Let's delve into their journey.\nJourney of Meesho founders\nVidit Aatrey and Sanjeev Barnwal were classmates at IIT, Delhi. After graduating from IIT, Barnwal moved to Japan where he joined Sony's Core Tech team. Despite having a high-paying job, he still had an aspiration to start something of his own.\nLater, he connected to his friend, Vidit Aatrey, who was then working at\xa0Bangalore-based InMobi firm. The duo left their respective jobs in 2015. While they were contemplating a startup idea, they envisioned a marketplace with the goal to develop a platform that could prioritise a business's success.\nIn late 2015, Meesho began operations at a small two-bedroom flat in Karnataka. Interestingly, their first workstation was a dining table in the apartment.\nBirth of Meesho\nVidit Aatrey and Sanjeev Barnwal came up with a simple idea - to enable anyone to start their own business online. Their experience at IIT Delhi and in the corporate world helped them discover that while giant e-commerce platforms were flourishing, there still was a need for an accessible platform where small businesses and individuals could sell their products.\nAnd rest is history! Meesho was then founded with the approach to provide an accessible platform, connecting suppliers\xa0manufacturers, and end consumers via social media channels such as Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and more.\nRise of Meesho\nMeesho stands for - Meri Shop (Apni Dukaan). In April 2021, its valuation reached 2.1 billion dollars. Moreover, by September 2021, it reached nearly 4.9 billion dollars, signalling that its success was merely the beginning.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"], 'https://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report-deepika-padukone-reacts-on-being-bollywood-s-highest-paid-actress-hope-we-get-to-a-day-3137674': ["Deepika Padukone reacts on being Bollywood's highest-paid actress, 'hope we get to a day...'", 'ENTERTAINMENT\nIn a recent interview, Deepika Padukone reacted on being Bollywood\'s highest-paid actress.\nApurwa Amit\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 02:33 PM IST\nDeepika Padukone, who rose to fame in Bollywood with her debut in 2007\'s "Om Shanti Om," has established herself as one of the industry\'s most influential and highest-paid actresses. However, in a recent statement, she expressed her hope for a future where such distinctions are no longer necessary.\nIn a recent interview with Forbes, Deepika reacted to the label of being "one of Bollywood’s highest-paid actresses." She said, “I mean, I hope we can get to a day where we don’t have to talk about it. The fact that we have to highlight or underline that I’m the highest paid… Hopefully, we’re getting there.”\nPadukone\'s comments come amidst ongoing discussions about gender pay gaps in the film industry and the progress towards achieving equal opportunities for women in Bollywood.\nA post shared by Deepika Padukone Fanpage (@deepikamagical)\nDuring an interview with\xa0American broadcaster Mika Brzezinski, Deepika also shared on \'self-worth.\' The Bajirao Mastani actor said, “From a psychological perspective, this urge may stem from early experiences where love or approval was conditional on achievement, reinforcing an unconscious belief that self-worth must be ‘earned’. In therapy, one would challenge the irrational belief that ‘I must be the best to be worthy’, helping individuals reframe success as multidimensional rather than a rigid metric,” she explained.\nShe also spoke candidly about her early years and career aspirations. Growing up in a family of athletes, Padukone revealed that she rarely watched movies. However, the few times she did attend a theatrical screening, she felt drawn to the world of cinema. She shared that seeing powerful female leads on screen inspired her, fueling her belief that she belonged in that world.\nThe Happy New Year actress highlighted the importance of mental health, emphasising its significance in her personal aspirations.

The singer-rapper has found himself in the middle of a controversy once again as a video from his recent concert is going viral for the wrong reasons. He is now accused of glorifying the killers of former Prime Minister India Gandhi during his live concert in London.\nAn allegedly pro-Khalistani social media handle named SherePanjabUK shared a video of Shubh flaunting a hoodie during his London show and wrote, “Punjabi Artist Shubh holding a hoodie of an illustration that shows Indian PM Indira Gandhi (aka maimuna begum) being greeted by Shaheed Bhai Satwant Singh and Shaheed Bhai Beant Singh #NeverForget84.”\n\nThe video, along with the caption referring to the late PM\'s assassins as martyrs, created a storm on social media. Shubh was accused of celebrating former PM Indra Gandia’s assassination. That the video was shared on her death anniversary made matters worse with social media users demanding a ban on him in India.\nA post shared by Akaal clothing (@akaal.clothing)\nHowever, upon closer inspection, it appears that the garment Shubh flaunted during his London concert was not the hoodie that was being advertised by the pro-Khalistani groups. Videos from the concert show that the hoodie Shubh was flaunting had a map of Punjab with the districts\' names clearly written on it. While the illustration was similar to the other hoodie depicting Indira Gandhi\'s assassination, it was not the same.\nA post shared by Akaal clothing\xa0 (@akaal.clothing)\nHowever, this has not stopped a lot of vitriol coming the singer\'s way. Actress Kangana Ranaut also criticised him and wrote on Twitter, “Celebrating the cowardly killing of an old woman by those who she appointed as her saviours. When you are trusted to protect but you take advantage of the trust and faith and use the same weapons to kill the ones were suppose to protect then it’s a shameful act of cowardice not of bravery. One must be ashamed of such a cowardly attack on an elderly lady who was disarmed and unaware, a lady who was the chosen leader of a democracy, nothing to glorify here Shubham ji. Shame !!!" Kangana will notably play late PM Indira Gandhi in her next film Emergency, which will release next year.\nEarlier, the singer shared a distorted map of India and had faced backlash for allegedly showing his support towards Khalistan and separatists. After this, celebs including Virat Kohli unfollowed him on social media and\xa0his India music tour called \'Still Rolling Tour\' was cancelled.\nCelebrating the cowardly killing of an old woman by those who she appointed as her saviours.\r\n\t\tWhen you are trusted to protect but you take advantage of the trust and faith and use the same weapons to kill the ones were suppose to protect then it’s a shameful act of cowardice not… https://t.co/GMqGjPeJQu\nLater, he took to social media and apologised for this act and said it was unintentional. He wrote, "As a young rapper-singer hailing from Punjab, India, it was my life’s dream to put my music on an international dais. But the recent happenings have tumbled my hard work and progress, and I wanted to say a few words to express my dismay and sorrow. I’m extremely disheartened by the cancellation of my tour in India. I was highly amped up and enthusiastic to perform in my country, in front of my people. The preparations were in full swing and I was practicing with my heart and soul for the last two months. And I was very excited, happy, and ready to perform. But I guess destiny had some other plans."\n"India is MY country too. I was born here.

We took our scooters and rode to the bank of the Tungabhadra Canal, near Durgamma Gudi, near Sanapur Lake. While we were watching the stars and playing the guitar, around 10:30 pm, three men approached us on a motorcycle, asking for petrol in Kannada," the homestay operator alleged.\nShe told them that there was no petrol station nearby and that they could find petrol in Sanapur. One of the three men suddenly demanded 100 rupees. "Since they did not know us, I told them that I did not have any money with me. However, as they repeatedly insisted, one of the male tourists gave them 20 rupees," the complainant said.\nWhen they refused to give them more money, the accused started arguing and threatening them with stones. Two of the accused allegedly assaulted and raped the homestay operator and Israeli tourist, while the third pushed the male tourists into the water canal, she said.\nAccording to the FIR, two of the accused assaulted the homestay operator, and the third man aggressively pushed the three male tourists into the canal. The accused also hit her with stones.\n"I was seriously bleeding...Two of the accused joined forces and dragged me to the side of the canal. One of them strangled me and took off my clothes.

This historic call connected then West Bengal Chief Minister Jyoti Basu with Union Communication Minister Sukh Ram. It was made using a Nokia handset on the Modi Telstra network, a joint venture between India’s BK Modi and Australia’s Telstra.\nThe call bridged two major cities—Kolkata and New Delhi—marking the beginning of mobile communication in India. However, at that time, mobile phones were a luxury. Making a call cost Rs 8.4 per minute, and both incoming and outgoing calls were charged. During peak hours, the cost doubled to Rs 16.8 per minute, making it affordable only for a few.\nOver the years, mobile communication in India has transformed drastically. High call rates are now a thing of the past, thanks to technological advancements and competition. A major breakthrough came in 2016 when Jio launched affordable data plans, revolutionising the telecom industry.\nToday, mobile phones are an essential part of everyday life. Calls, messages, and internet access are available at low costs, making communication faster and easier for everyone.\nFrom that first call in 1995 to today’s seamless connectivity, India’s telecom journey is a story of growth, innovation, and accessibility.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"], 'https://www.dnaindia.com/topic/dna-snips': 'Error: Could not find an article title', 'https://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report-kiran-rao-says-her-parents-were-taken-aback-by-her-decision-to-marry-aamir-khan-they-were-worried-that-3137709': ["Kiran Rao says her parents were taken aback by her decision to marry Aamir Khan: 'They were worried that...'", 'ENTERTAINMENT\nFilmmaker Kiran Rao recently opened up on her marriage with Bollywood superstar Aamir Khan.

His plan of action not only included massive layoffs and harsh diktat for employees (12 hours a day shift, no rest day), but also an intent to make the ‘highly coveted’ blue tick payable at USD 8 per month (approx. Rs 650 per month).\nWhile the second move seems to have been scrubbed in wake of the storm of fake handles getting the ‘Verified’ badge, industry experts believe that Musk’s ‘stunts’ might leave the social media giant in the lurch.\nAccording to Statista, Twitter has about 23.6 million users (as of January 2022) in India. However, India reportedly accounts only for a small percentage of Twitter’s revenue. The registered entity of Twitter in India recorded Rs 86.39 crore as revenue in FY21. But this was just 0.23 percent of the global revenue. In FY22, though its revenue jumped by about 82 percent, to Rs 156.75 crore, the India entity posted a net loss of Rs 31.84 crore for FY22.\nAmid all the chaos around Twitter and its owner Musk making headlines almost every day, we thought of discussing this fiasco with someone who has been long associated with Twitter and got the opportunity to have a detailed discussion with Naina Redhu, arguably the first Twitter user in India. Naina spoke at length on her 16-year journey on Twitter and how she sees the major revamp that Elon Musk tends to bring to the social media platform.\nHere are the edited excerpts of the interview:\nSince when have you been on the platform? How did you end up signing onto the platform?\nI signed up to the platform in 2006, back when it was called TWTTR. I had a job in Mumbai and I was very interested in the way the internet was coming up and blogging was a thing, at least abroad, not in India. I started my first blog in 2004 so I was quite involved with the things that were happening online.\xa0\r\n\t\xa0\nHow was your experience back then?\nBack then, I think I remember very clearly that I signed on and I was very curious to know what was happening. I saw that there were a few people who were writing texts on the screen and they were talking as if they already knew each other. I noticed that all of them were located in Palo Alto, California and they were all planning to meet up for a coffee or a pizza. And I was just hoping that there was somebody in Bombay that I could say that to. But there was no one else. I thought that maybe the platform is only for the US audience and it wasn’t meant for someone in India.\nIs that how you figured out that you were the first Twitter user?\nSomeone told me that ‘I think you might be the first twitter user from India.’ They then pointed me to an article that said ‘The first 140 people to sign up to Twitter’ and when I checked it out I couldn’t find a single Indian or an India-sounding name on that list. I thought that this could be true. I then wrote an article on my blog ‘Am I the first Indian Twitter user?’ A lot of people responded by saying that they cannot find any other Indian user. No one really dug deep but its commonly thought that I am the first Twitter user from India.\nWhat have been the drastic changes that you have noticed from 2006 to 2022?\nOne was of course the character limit change. From 140 to 280 characters which I think took away the essence of Twitter because with 140 characters, what I used to do was try really hard to compress what I was talking about in 140 characters. But with the 280 characters and the whole ‘thread-system’, it has become like a blog.\nOne thing that I miss is the ‘Fail Whale’ where a blue color whale popped up when the platform would crash because, maybe, they could not keep up with the demand of the users all over the world. The ‘Fail Whale’ has gone which is great for Twitter and the services that they provide but I miss it because once in a while, we would go like ‘Oh yeah, even I saw a Fail Whale. Did you see it?’\nBut the community aspect of Twitter has been lost. And I haven't seen it coming back. I remember going for ‘Tweet-Ups’ for everyone who is on Twitter who would've met or chatted, we would go to a restaurant, meet them, chat, have food and actually get to know the person in real life. I don’t think anyone would ever do that, on Twitter at least. The platform was a lot more of learning, talking to new people, learning about new things etc.\nThe platform has become a lot more politics, and a lot more controversial topics are talked about which is not really a bad thing but I do feel that the personal touch in the smaller community aspect has definitely gone which I miss.\nAfter Elon musk’s takeover, there have been a bunch of changes on the platform. The company was recently planning to impose subscription fee for the verification badge. Do you think people would be willing to pay for the blue tick?\nI don’t have clarity over it yet because I saw that screenshots were shared with 2 badges. One was the blue tick and the other was the ‘Official’ tag. I think they are still trying to decide what to do with the blue tick because the verification sign has always been there to determine or to verify that this is the real person in real life who is also on Twitter. They are trying to change that but I am not sure what it will mean, yet.\nThe USD 8 dollars initially was for Twitter Blue subscription where you could see lesser ads and there were a bunch of other features. But why would I pay money to see lesser ads? If taking money, then say no ads. Although I don’t use Twitter as much anymore.\nElon Musk had tweeted that they are experimenting different things on the platform and they will see what works and what doesn’t. Was it the same earlier?\nThat’s what I loved about twitter. That’s what it used to be. In the early days when it had started picking up, there was a lot of stuff happening and we would give feedback to Twitter and they would respond by saying that they are trying out stuff. I know that Elon is a very polarising figure. There are some people who love him and some who absolutely hate him and there is no middle ground. But I think that he is trying something and I am really excited to see what happens and where it goes. The blue tick has represented something till now but we don’t know about now. It might change, it might not change.\nTwitter Blue was going to roll out the ‘edit’ button. But with Elon Musk’s takeover, things might change.\nRight, we don’t have much clarity over what might happen. And honestly, I have survived Twitter without the ‘edit’ button for 16 years, I am not going to pay for it.\nWe pay a subscription fee to a lot of platforms like, say, Netflix and we get to watch movies in return. What about Twitter? Do you think that the USD 8 per month fee will be worth it?\nNo. I don’t know, honestly. I really need to know what the blue tick would mean in the future. And if it is adding value, then, yeah, sure. The value it has added so far is that people know that it’s actually me that they're talking to, it’s me who they’re getting in touch with. I don’t think that the blue tick adds value to me in any way. Again, I would really need to see where it's going and what they're planning to do, to be honest.\nEven if we don’t have verified accounts, the normal accounts still add value to a platform like twitter.\nDon’t you think that the blue tick helps us differentiate between the parody/fake accounts from the actual/verified accounts?\nIf it’s a political figure, I think it's important for them to have a blue tick to say that this is in fact the real person. I don’t face the same issues that Narendra Modi or Rahul Gandhi would face. And I'm sure that politicians have deep pockets and paying those $8 dollars would be nothing for them.\nDo you think that the subscription plan would be successful in India, given that all the plan provides is a verification badge?\nI will not subscribe. I cannot say for anyone else in India but I wouldn’t take the plan. The reason I have, say, a Spotify premium account is because I don’t want to listen to ads. I have twitter and I can’t really delete my account since I am the first user but paying Twitter the money wouldn’t add any value to my life so I don’t see why I would subscribe to anything on Twitter.\nDon’t you think that if Twitter takes this up, other platforms might start their own subscription plan for a ‘no-ad’ policy?\nNo, I don’t think so. What other platforms are there, really? If you talk about Instagram, it's really hard to decipher if it's an ad, a paid promotion, or just some page that I already follow. There are some ads that are actually useful and I really like. Instagram’s ad algorithm is really quick and picks up what you’re looking for but that’s not the case with Twitter. Twitter really needs to work on its ad algorithm.\nDo you think people are migrating to other platforms like Koo or Mastodon?\nI have heard of a lot of platforms and have tried them but they can't compete with what twitter has to offer, the loyalty that Twitter has had. They were the first platform to do what they did and it took off for them. So, I think no one can compete with Twitter. Even if people don’t end up paying the $8, they will continue using the free account but they're not migrating to another platform. Twitter has the audience and the major population on it. Unless there is a mass exodus and Elon Musk really messes it up, I don’t it's going to change. Everybody wants to be where everyone else is.\nThis is the most people have spoken about Twitter on Twitter. I'm really excited with what Musk plans to do with the platform.\nWatch the full interview here:\n\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"], 'https://www.dnaindia.com/cricket/report-ind-vs-nz-champions-trophy-2025-final-rohit-sharma-loses-12th-consecutive-toss-equals-brian-lara-s-unwanted-record-3137681': ['IND vs NZ Final: Rohit Sharma loses 12th consecutive toss, equals Brian Lara’s unwanted record', "CRICKET\nIndia has kept the same lineup as in their last match, featuring a mix of four spinners and two pacers, Mohammed Shami and Hardik Pandya.\nChankesh Rao\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 03:06 PM IST\nRohit Sharma's unfortunate run at the coin toss continued, marking the 12th time in a row that the Indian captain has been unable to gain the upper hand. New Zealand, having won the toss, chose to bat first, setting the stage for an exciting chase at the renowned Dubai International Stadium during the Champions Trophy final.\nWith this latest toss loss, Rohit Sharma has now matched the unfortunate record held by West Indies great Brian Lara, who experienced a similar streak of 12 consecutive toss losses between October 1998 and May 1999. Furthermore, India has now lost the toss in 15 straight ODI matches.\nIndia has kept the same lineup as in their last match, featuring a mix of four spinners and two pacers, Mohammed Shami and Hardik Pandya. In contrast, New Zealand has had to make a change due to an injury to their top wicket-taker, Matt Henry. Right-arm pacer Nathan Smith will take Henry's place in the playing XI.\nHistorically, India and New Zealand have met four times in ICC knock-out matches, with New Zealand winning three of those encounters. Notably, New Zealand triumphed in the Champions Trophy 2000 Final, the World Cup 2019 Semifinal, and the World Test Championship 2021 Final. However, India managed to secure a win in the World Cup 2023 Semifinal.\nIn total, India and New Zealand have faced each other 12 times in ICC tournaments, with both teams winning six matches each. It's worth mentioning that India boasts an impressive 90 percent winning record at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium, having won 9 out of 10 ODI matches played there.

Even their horror films, like I saw a film called \'Bramayugam,\' which is a Mammootty film, incredibly artistically made using folk tales and the folklore of Kerala, and it\'s a very different idea. There is a sort of a sense of conviction about telling stories that are different. And I think that\'s what stands them in great stead."\nKiran, however, shared that the makers in South cinema are ready to take chances as it\'s a small industry, and they know their audience very well. "It\'s the chances that they are taking with the stories they are telling, and perhaps that also comes from the fact that they are usually smaller industries that are technically only catering to their own, culturally, their language and their community. And so they are quite unafraid to try different things. They know their audience, and their producers are willing to take chances on new storytelling," she added.\nShe said what is incredible is that "the audience is going to watch films," and the makers are "very much in touch with their audience. They understand their audience very well." However, she shared that Bollywood is big, and while making the movie, filmmakers keep in mind that they have to cater for a "wider audience". "You are making films for a diaspora, you are making films for all the states of the country. And I think maybe that is why people want to make something that they are very sure will succeed, and maybe that\'s why there\'s a tendency to go to a film that\'s already successful, like a remake," she said. She insisted that it is important to have "producers who are willing to take a chance" if you are willing to have a different cinema.\nRao started her career as the assistant director in the epic film \'Lagaan\', directed by Ashutosh Gowariker, whom she also assisted later on \'Swades: We, the People\'. Lagaan was nominated for the 74th Academy Award in the foreign language film category. Aamir Khan produced and starred in the same film. Before \'Lagaan\', she also played a minute role as a supporting actress in \'Dil Chahta Hai\'. She has directed the films \'Dhobi Ghat\' (2011) and \'Laapataa Ladies\' (2024).\n\r\n\t(This story has not been edited by DNA staff and is published from ANI)\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa\' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says \'Big Fan\' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress\' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina'], 'https://www.dnaindia.com/automobile': ["MS Dhoni's IPL future confirmed?

This move paves the way for a comprehensive bill to be introduced in the ongoing Winter Session of Parliament. As per the latest development, the introduction of the bill has been delayed.\nAs per the revised list of business in the Lok Sabha, the two bills approved by the Union Cabinet are The Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-Ninth Amendment) Bill, 2024, and The Union Territories Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024.\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been pushing for One Nation, One Election. The Winter Session of Parliament, which started on November 25, is expected to discuss this issue before concluding on December 20.\nWhat is ‘One Nation, One Election’ bill?\nThe proposed "One Nation, One Election" legislation aims to synchronize elections for the Lok Sabha and state assemblies across India. This means that voters would cast their ballots for both national and state elections on the same day or within a specific timeframe. The idea behind this proposal is to reduce election costs, minimize disruptions to governance, and streamline administrative work. According to estimates, elections to the Lok Sabha and legislative assemblies cost the Election Commission of India over Rs 4,500 crore.\nHow it will change the way polls are conducted in India?\nThe proposed legislation would amend Articles 82A, 83(2), and 327 of the Constitution to enable simultaneous elections. The bill is expected to be introduced in the ongoing winter session of Parliament, which ends on December 20, 2024. Some opposition leaders have expressed concerns that the proposal could undermine federalism and the autonomy of state governments. It is believed that holding simultaneous elections would require significant logistical efforts, including the deployment of security forces and election officials.

Taking to X, Choksi gave figures that show the influence of Gujarati community in India’s economy.\nVaishali Shastri\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 04:16 PM IST\nIn India, we often see one community mainly dominating the business sector, that is Gujaratis. Gujaratis are globally recognized for their exceptional business skills and entrepreneurial drive, boasting a remarkable record of success. Gujarat, India's western hub, is renowned for nurturing successful entrepreneurs, thanks to its rich cultural heritage that instills strong work ethics, business values, and a commerce-friendly mindset from a young age.\nAbhijit Choksi, founder of Stockifi and a Gujarati, explained through an analysis on the Gujarati dominance in business and finance. Taking to X, Choksi gave figures that show the influence of Gujarati community in India’s economy. He wrote, “108 out of India’s 191 billionaires are Gujarati.” His post on Gujarati community dominating the business market went viral. While posting this, he also brought to light a very frequent question that makes people curious about their dominance in India’s business sector. “Gujarat, which has 5% of India’s population, contributes over 8% to the GDP and 18% of the industrial output,” he wrote.\n108 out of 191 Indian billionaires are Gujarati.\n\r\n\t\tA Gujarati living in America makes three times more than an average American.\n\r\n\t\tGujarat, which has 5% of India’s population, contributes over 8% to the GDP and 18% of the industrial output.\n\r\n\t\tGujarat has a land area of only 6% but… pic.twitter.com/ZId5idzCNS\nCiting facts, Abhijit Choksi highlighted that “a Gujarati living in America makes three times more than an average American.”\xa0 What is more astounding is that “Gujarat has a land area of only 6% but accounts for 25% of India’s total exports,” mentioned Abhijit Choksi. Gujaratis dominate various industries, but some of them where they are mostly seen include diamond trading and stock markets. In the U.S., they own over 60% of motels, showcasing their global economic impact.\nSo, now the question is, “Why is the Gujarati community so insanely successful in business and finance?” Chokshi suggests it is because of two reasons: Generational wisdom and an entrepreneurial mindset, along with an unparalleled quality to adapt, learn the art and nuisances of markets, and thereby take new markets. He lists out 20 reasons why Gujaratis are not participants in the Indian economy or elsewhere too but also define them.\nChokshi also points out to a fact that is one of the main attributes of the Gujarati success. He said that Gujaratis prefer business over jobs and that is the case throughout generations. “Naukri toh gareebon ka dhanda che” (Jobs are for the poor) is a common belief in Gujarati families. In Gujarati households, children are raised with guidance on businesses and their families managing cash flow, cracking deals, assessing risks and business being a way of life rather than just a means of earning around them makes them curious towards this and fill their mentality with business aspects since the start.\nAnother trait he highlighted is that of risk-taking, this is according to Choksi, one of the defining traits. From such business opportunities like diamond trading to even risky areas like stock markets, Gujaratis naturally adapt to uncertainties and take opportunities. They can do this as since their education days they were fed with financial education. Children of businessmen help their family members from a young age and throughout learn real-world economics that are not even taught in big MBA schools.\nGujaratis' success is fueled by a strong support network, where they provide each other with financial assistance, guidance, and business opportunities. Their thrifty lifestyle also contributes to their prosperity, as they prioritize reinvesting profits over lavish spending, resulting in sustained wealth growth.\nChokshi also tells how Gujaratis dominate diamond market. “Surat alone processes 90% of the world’s diamonds,” he highlighted, and explaining how Gujarati entrepreneurs outrun their competitors in Belgium and Israel. He also noted that more than 60% of India’s stock market traders are Gujarati or Marwari, shaping financial markets for centuries.\nSome of the top Gujarati businessmen who are India’s richest and even among richest businessmen in the world are:\nGautam Adani of Ahmedabad-based multinational conglomerate, Adani Group. He has a net worth of Rs 140,200 crore.\nMukesh Ambani of Reliance Industries with a net worth of Rs 8,134 lakh crore\nNirma brand’s founder Karsanbhai Patel who has a net worth of Rs 31,500 crore\nAjim Premji of Wipro who has a net worth of Rs 96,500.40 crores\nUday Kotak of the Kotak Mahindra Group has a net worth of Rs 1,11,474 crore.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"], 'https://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-big-update-on-bullet-train-project-to-cut-travel-time-will-pass-through-5-key-districts-check-route-stoppages-and-top-speed-3137622': ['BIG update on bullet train: Project to cut travel time, will pass through 5 key districts, check route, stoppages and top speed', "INDIA\nThis project is expected to boost Bihar’s economy, create jobs, and improve connectivity across major cities\nShivam Verma\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 11:32 AM IST\nBihar is preparing for a major transformation in its railway network with the introduction of its first bullet train. The high-speed rail will run on a 260-kilometer elevated track, passing through five key districts, including Patna. The National High-Speed Rail Corporation Limited (NHSRCL) is working on the project, with the Detailed Project Report (DPR) expected to be completed by August, according to reports.\nThis bullet train will be a part of the Varanasi-Patna-Howrah High-Speed Rail Corridor, covering a total distance of 800 kilometers. In Bihar, the train will pass through Patna, Buxar, Ara, Jehanabad, and Gaya.\nThe project will be completed in two phases. The first phase will connect Varanasi to Howrah via important stations like Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya Junction, Ara, Buxar, Patna, and Gaya. The second phase will extend the route from Delhi to Varanasi, linking Delhi to Howrah through a high-speed network.\nThe bullet train in Bihar will run at a top speed of 350 km/h, drastically cutting travel time. It will be based on Japanese technology and will feature modern amenities such as automatic doors, CCTV cameras for security, and mobile charging points for passenger convenience.\nIn Patna alone, the project will require around 135 hectares of land across 58 villages. Authorities have started the land acquisition process, offering four times the market value for rural land and twice the market value for urban properties, according to reports.\nThe NHSRCL is set to appoint an agency to finalise the DPR, which will outline costs, timelines, and technical details.

We know a lot about her from her being ‘daddy’s li’l girl’ to making it big in Bollywood and a strong mark in Hollywood as well. However, fans and audience alike are still unaware of unheard and untold stories about PC. How Priyanka Chopra made it big in Bollywood and Hollywood, what was Priyanka Chopra’s childhood and relations with parents are some of the aspects her fans are unaware of.\nHer mother Madhu Chopra recently talked about the actor who’s 2008 critically acclaimed film Fashion got re-released. She talked about parenting, what made her regret many decisions, and Priyanka Chopra’s career\nMadhu Chopra, in an interview with Pinkvilla, said that she always wanted a girl and is very proud as the mother of Priyanka Chopra. She said that Priyanka Chopra was academically good, especially in mathematics and physics and wanted to pursue engineering. Her mother said that her daughter was confident since childhood. Being parents’ ‘laadli’ daughter, Priyanka Chopra was always supported by her parents who kept her in the safe space but also taught tough lessons for life.\nMadhu Chopra revealed that she always said, “Consequences of your decisions are you own and always have courage of conviction.” Priyanka Chopra was taught to be fearless, have courage and confidence and make self-decisions.\nPriyanka Chopra’s mother Madhu Chopra also revealed what was her biggest regret and why Priyanka Chopra was sent to boarding school. Madhu Copra revealed that at a very early age Priyanka was sent to boarding school. She said that it was her biggest regret as Priyanka Chopra was a ‘laadli’ and lived in a secure family environment. When she was sent to boarding she was not prepared for it and living away from family traumatised her as well as mother Madhu Chopra. “I never regretted any decision regarding her as such and had courage of conviction. I only regret sending her to boarding school not any other decision. I traumatised her by sending her to boarding school and she was not prepared. So, sending her there was heartbreaking for both of us.” She also said that when they went for admissions, Priyanka passed the test well and her mother left her there.\nEven then, Priyanka Chopra stayed there and did well in her school but for her mother, it is still traumatising. Madhu Chopra also revealed why she was sent to boarding school and said that it was due to a small reason. “She gave back answer to papa when he called her while she was playing with a doll, ‘can't you see I’m busy’ and I was like, she is speaking my language.”\n\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"], 'https://www.dnaindia.com/bollywood/report-india-biggest-hit-film-sholay-bigger-than-chhaava-stree-2-jawan-kalki-2898-ad-baahubali-rrr-dangal-was-made-for-just-rs-3-crore-became-all-time-blockbuster-earned-rs-3137501': ["India's biggest hit film, bigger than Chhaava, Stree 2, Jawan, Kalki 2898 AD, Baahubali, RRR, Dangal, was made for just Rs 3 crore, became all time blockbuster, earned Rs..", "BOLLYWOOD\nWe are talking about Ramesh Sippy's superhit film Sholay, which was released in 1975, starring Amitabh Bachchan, Jaya Bachchan, Dharmendra, Hema Malini, and Sanjeev Kumar in lead roles.

While Bollywood has managed to catch up with its recent releases like Jawan, Pathaan, Stree 2, and Gadar 2, the discussion of South vs Bollywood is at an all-time high. However, today we will tell you about a time when Bollywood films became such big hits that their tickets were sold in lakhs. There was one such Bollywood film, whose budget and earnings are difficult to surpass even today. This is not a South film, but a Bollywood Hindi film whose records are unbroken to date. This film is also the most-watched film to date.\nToday, we will tell you about one such film that made such a record in its name, which no film has been able to break to date. Many stars were seen together in this film and compared to now, it was made on the lowest budget, which broke records of earnings.\nWe are talking about Ramesh Sippy's superhit film Sholay, which was released in 1975, starring Amitabh Bachchan, Jaya Bachchan, Dharmendra, Hema Malini, and Sanjeev Kumar in lead roles. Sholay held the title of the highest-grossing Indian film since its release and held it for almost a decade.\nAs per IMDb, Sholay has been re-released many times over the years and has continually attracted 15-18 crore viewers in Indian theatres. The film also did great business worldwide, especially in Soviet Russia where 4.8 crore tickets were sold initially and 6 crore tickets in total. Interestingly, Sholay was made on a budget of just Rs 3 crore in that era.\nReports state that 25 crore tickets of Sholay were sold out instantly after its release. The ticket price, at the time, was only Rs 2. Sholay, released in 1975, did a business of Rs 35 crore worldwide. According to today's inflation, this figure is equivalent to about Rs 2800 crore, which is much more than any Indian film except Mughal-e-Azam.\nRecently, in August 2024, this blockbuster and cult classic film written by Salim Javed was re-released at Regal Cinema in Mumbai.

Over the years, they have come to be recognised as India's most influential figures.\nAs they celebrate six years of marriage, let’s take a closer look at their heartwarming love story, which inspires belief in ‘happily ever after’.\nFor those who may not know, Shloka and Akash were childhood sweethearts who attended the same school. According to rumours, Akash secretly harboured feelings for Shloka but took his time to express them. After finishing their 12th-grade exams, Akash finally mustered the courage to confess his love. Fortunately for him, Shloka said yes—and the rest, as they say, is history.\nAfter that, the two continued their education by studying overseas.\xa0 Despite living in different places, it's incredible how the two remained in contact and deeply in love. They actively participated in their father's business after they got back to India.\nUp until March 2018, when a photo of the two of them together with Shloka kissing Akash on the cheek became viral, the couple kept a low profile. The photo, which was taken at a gathering in Goa, generated a lot of attention on social media and led to rumours that the couple will soon get married.\nThe couple's engagement at a five-star resort in Goa in March 2018 put an end to rumours. On March 9, 2019, Akash and Shloka tied the knot in a grand wedding ceremony. The occasion was graced by an array of high-profile guests, including Ratan Tata, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, and New Zealand cricketer Shane Bond, showcasing the couple’s prominent place in both social and business circles.\nThe two have always been spotted holding hands and grinning broadly whenever they have appeared together. In 2022, the couple welcomed a son named Prithvi, and in 2023, they welcomed a daughter named Veda Akash Ambani.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"], 'https://www.dnaindia.com/explainer/report-delhi-residents-report-hearing-mysterious-and-loud-boom-sound-during-4-magnitude-earthquake-know-what-caused-it-3133319': ['Delhi residents report hearing mysterious ‘boom’ sound during earthquake; what caused it?', "EXPLAINER\nThe earthquake that hit Delhi on Monday had a depth of about 5 kilometers, according to the National Centre of Seismology, making it a shallow-focus earthquake.

A loud boom sound was also heard by people when the quake struck. Here’s what caused the mysterious sound.\nWhat was the boom sound?\r\n\tThe earthquake that hit Delhi on Monday had a depth of about 5 kilometers, according to the National Centre of Seismology, making it a shallow-focus earthquake. During such quakes, loud rumbling or boom sounds are often heard.\nThis is because high-frequency ground vibrations from shallow earthquakes reach the atmosphere and become sound waves.\nThe shallower the earthquake’s epicentre, the greater its potential to generate loud sounds.\n“When earthquakes are deeper, those vibrations never reach the surface. Sometimes, earthquakes create booming sounds even when no vibrations are felt,” according to the US Geological Survey (USGS).\nEarthquake in Delhi\r\n\tAn earthquake with a magnitude of 4 on the Richter Scale struck Delhi around 5:30 am on Monday. The epicentre of the quake was Jheel Park in Dhaula Kuan area, according to the National Center for Seismology.\nAn earthquake below 2.5 magnitude is considered “mild” and does not cause tremors. A quake with magnitude between 2.5 and 5.4 is labeled “moderate,” causing minor tremors. Those above 5.4 magnitude are considered “severe” earthquakes and have the potential to cause strong tremors and damage.\nDelhi is described by experts as being at moderate to high risk of experiencing earthquakes.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"], 'https://www.dnaindia.com/india/video-cbse-class-10-board-exams-2-board-exams-for-class-10-for-2025-26-here-s-what-draft-proposal-says-3135286': ['CBSE Class 10 Board Exams 2 Board Exams For Class 10 For 2025-26 Heres What Draft Proposal Says', 'INDIA\nStarting from 2026, class 10 CBSE students will have the opportunity to take board exams twice a year.

In a heartfelt message, he shared how his granddaughters have strengthened his resolve to build a world where women face no barriers in achieving their dreams. Gautam Adani spoke about the strong women who shaped his journey, including his mother, wife Priti Adani, and others that he met through his work.\nHe recalled how his mother managed their large family with resilience and how his wife\'s dedication to the Adani Foundation has transformed lives across rural India.\nIn a social media post he said, "A decade ago, as I cradled my first granddaughter\'s delicate fingers, I made a silent vow: to help build a world where her aspirations would know no bounds, where her voice would resonate with the same respect as any man\'s, and where her worth would be measured solely by her character and contributions".\nHe further added, "Now, blessed with three beautiful granddaughters, this promise burns brighter and more urgent than ever. International Women\'s Day is not merely a date on the calendar; it\'s a poignant reminder of the strides we\'ve made and the journey that still lies ahead. For me, this mission is deeply personal across many dimensions - as a young boy being inspired by his mother, as a business leader witnessing the challenges faced by women in leadership, as a husband inspired by my wife Priti\'s unwavering dedication to the Adani Foundation, and as a grandfather dreaming of a world without limits for the girls who affectionately call me "Dadu."\nHe also highlighted key initiatives by the Adani Foundation, such as the Butterfly Effect framework, which supports women throughout different stages of life, and the Lakhpati Didis program, which has helped over 1,000 women achieve financial independence.\nHe said "Moreover, our \'Lakhpati Didis\' initiative celebrates over 1,000 women who have achieved financial independence through enhanced entrepreneurial skills". Gautam Adani shared a personal experience of visiting one of his company\'s ports, where he noticed the lack of women in leadership roles. This led him to push for change, ensuring policies were more inclusive and providing mentorship opportunities for women.\nHe added, "Several years ago, during a visit to one of our port projects, I noticed the absence of women in operational and leadership roles. It was not due to a lack of capability but rather the absence of pathways for them into these traditionally male-dominated fields. This realization sparked a personal commitment to change".\nDespite progress, he acknowledged that many women still face challenges in leadership roles. He expressed hope that his granddaughters would one day enter boardrooms where they are valued as equals.\nGautam Adani said, "Yet, beneath that pride is a quiet impatience. Because despite how far we have come, my granddaughters may still enter boardrooms where they are the only women at the table. They may still have to fight harder, speak louder, and prove themselves twice over to receive the recognition they deserve. They may still face doors that open too slowly, or not at all".\nFor his granddaughters he added "And to my granddaughters, who may one day read this: My dearest girls, The world you inherit should be one where your brilliance is met with open doors, not glass ceilings. Where your ambitions are never questioned, only encouraged. Where your voice is not just heard, but sought after. I vow to keep pushing, to keep breaking barriers, until that world is not just a vision but a reality. Because you, and every girl like you, deserve to walk into every room knowing you belong. Your Dadu."\nConcluding his message, he urged men in leadership positions to see gender equality as a shared responsibility, stating, "The talents, insights, and leadership of women are invaluable resources we cannot afford to squander.\n"This year\'s International Women\'s Day theme, Accelerate Action, resonates deeply with vision of creating an inclusive future where every woman can thrive".\nExcept for the headline, the story has not been edited by DNA staff and is published from ANI.\n\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa\' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says \'Big Fan\' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress\' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina'], 'https://www.dnaindia.com/viral/report-meet-man-diwakar-paswan-whose-father-asked-for-donations-for-son-shoes-now-wins-a-gold-medal-in-3137745': ['Meet man, whose father asked for donations for his shoes, now wins gold medal in...', "VIRAL\nThis achievement of the man is a proud moment for his entire village and his father's dream is now that son represents India in the Olympics.\nPrashant Tamta\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 05:37 PM IST\nThey say 'hard work always pays off'.

His family was told by the doctors that he had slipped into a coma and that he required immediate medical attention and expensive treatment.\nFearing for his life, Ninama\'s wife and mother somehow started arranging the money, borrowing from friends and relatives. However, what happened next shocked everyone! In a viral video, now being widely circulated online, Ninama casually walked out the hospital with no signs of the severe condition he was being kept in the hospital for.\nHe alleged that he was forcibly held captive by five doctors, while they pressurised his family for the large amount of money. Despite this, he managed to escape their custody, later exposing them over their reported scam.\n\nA post shared by Jist (@jist.news)\nLater, his wife confirmed the incident and said, "They told us he had a spinal fracture and had fallen into a coma. They handed us prescriptions, and we bought everything they asked for. Then, they told us to pay Rs 1 lakh for the treatment. We had to beg our relatives for money. We ran from one place to another and finally managed to gather the amount".\nThe incident has sparked concerns over irrationally expensive treatment costs charged by private hospitals, with netizens demanding stricter regulations to curb such unfair practices.\n\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa\' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says \'Big Fan\' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress\' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina'], 'https://www.dnaindia.com/web-stories/viral/secrets-to-longevity-what-we-can-learn-from-japanese-eating-habits-1741518739999': 'Error: Could not find an article body', 'https://www.dnaindia.com/business': ["MS Dhoni's IPL future confirmed?

Officials do not see the Trump administration\'s threats as empty; they see a new normal when it comes to the United States, the report added.\n\r\n\t(This story has not been edited by DNA staff and is published from ANI).\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa\' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says \'Big Fan\' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress\' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina'], 'https://www.dnaindia.com/business/report-months-after-ratan-tata-death-tata-sons-chairman-n-chandrasekaran-shares-heartfelt-memory-in-last-few-years-3137646': ["Months after Ratan Tata's death, Tata Sons Chairman N Chandrasekaran shares heartfelt memory: 'In last few years...'", 'BUSINESS\nRatan Tata, who passed away last year at the age of 86, led the Tata Group for over two decades\nShivam Verma\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 01:08 PM IST\nTata Sons\' chairman N Chandrasekaran recently shared a heartfelt memory of Ratan Tata at an event.

However, one actor has appeared in a total of eight films that have been submitted to the Oscars, the highest number by any Indian actor to date.\nThe record is held by Raghubir Yadav, whose films sent to the Oscars include Salaam Bombay!, Rudaali, Bandit Queen, 1947 Earth, Lagaan, Water, Peepli Live, and Newton (in chronological order). Among these, Salaam Bombay!, Lagaan, and Water even got shortlisted among the final five nominees in the Best Foreign Film category but failed to win the award. Additionally, Water was submitted as Canada’s official entry to the Oscars, while the other seven were sent from India.\nKamal Haasan is second on this list, with seven of his films being submitted as India’s official entries to the Academy Awards. These include Saagar, Swathi Muthyam, Nayakan, Thevar Magan, Kuruthipunal, Indian, and Hey Ram (in chronological order). However, none of these films received a nomination among the final five in the Best Foreign Language Film category.\nApart from Mira Nair's Salaam Bombay! and Ashutosh Gowariker's Lagaan, Mehboob Khan's Mother India is the only other Indian film to have been nominated for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film. SS Rajamouli's RRR, Ritesh Batra's The Lunchbox, and Payal Kapadia's All We Imagine As Light could have been strong contenders to bring home the Oscar if they would have been sent as India's official entry to the Academy Awards.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"], 'https://www.dnaindia.com/cricket/report-india-vs-new-zealand-champions-trophy-2025-final-fans-thrilled-as-cricketers-share-heartwarming-phone-wallpapers-3137536': ['India vs New Zealand Champions Trophy 2025 Final: Fans thrilled as cricketers share heartwarming phone wallpapers', "CRICKET\nThe India vs New Zealand Champions Trophy 2025 final is set for March 9, 2025, at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium, with excitement building among fans as the two teams meet again after their 2000 final.\nPravrajya Suruchi\nUpdated : Mar 08, 2025, 07:51 PM IST\nThe excitement is reaching fever pitch as Indian fans eagerly await the highly anticipated final of the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 between India and New Zealand.

But now the focus has been shifted to the benefits from development—based on categories, religions, and castes. This change brought religious issues into the campaign discourse. Sourabh Raaj Jain, anchor of DNA Zed News today, analysed how the focus of the 2024 Lok Sabha election will change from development to religion.\nSpeeches during election rallies shifted from reservations to religious reservations, and concerns regarding the division of land among various faiths surfaced. Lately, the discourse has intensified to an eighty-twenty proportions gulf, prompting conversations concerning Ghazwa-e-Hind via religious reservation.\nIt raises the fundamental question: does the Hindu-Muslim divide affect actual life, or is it confined to electoral politics?\nIn general, no party is exclusive when it comes to incorporating religious themes into politics. A review of several remarks shows that religious overtones work well for all political parties during elections.\nThe remarks made by BJP leader and Amravati candidate Navneet Rana reflect this viewpoint. Rana challenged Akbaruddin Owaisi and his brother Asaduddin Owaisi in Hyderabad, saying if police were removed from duty for 15 seconds, the brothers "would not know from where they came and where they went"\n"I always stand by my statement. I am not afraid of anyone. We are committed to giving a reply to those who are working for Pakistan in India. If they will take 15 minutes, we will take 15 seconds," Navneet Rana said. Rana was heard saying in a video clip she posted on her X handle, tagging the Owaisi brothers, "The younger brother says, \'Remove the police for 15 minutes so that we can show them what we can do\'. I want to tell the younger brother (Akbaruddin) that it might take you 15 minutes, but it will only take us 15 seconds. It will take us all of 15 seconds if we come to the forefront."Reacting to BJP leader Navneet Rana\'s "15-second lagenge" remark, All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen leader Asaduddin Owaisi on Thursday asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to give her one hour instead of 15 seconds and asserted they are not "scared" of the BJP leader.\n"I tell Modi ji - give her 15 seconds. What will you do? Give her 15 seconds, give her 1 hour. We, too, want to see if you have any humanity left in you. Who is scared? We are ready...If someone is making an open call for it, then so be it. PM is yours; RSS is yours; everything is yours. Do it. Who is stopping you? Tell us where we have to come, we will be there. Do it," Owaisi told reporters on Thursday.\nAt a meeting in 2013, Akbaruddin warned "100 crore Hindus" that his community would show what it could do if the police were withdrawn for \'15 minutes\'. After fellow party member Navneet Rana\'s \'15 seconds lagenge\' remark stoked controversy, Bharatiya Janata Party leader Madhavi Latha on Thursday said that the former wanted to convey to the citizens that it will only take 15 seconds to cast their vote, which will help the nation move towards \'Viksit Bharat\'.\nSpeaking to ANI, BJP\'s Hyderabad Lok Sabha seat candidate, Madhavi Latha, said, "We do not threaten anyone. We do not say to remove the police force for 15 minutes. We just want to say that you should take 15 seconds instead of 15 minutes and cast your vote. Do not go to attend provocative speeches. If you want to move towards \'Viksit Bharat\'. Go and cast your vote. This is what she (Navneet Rana) meant.\nAsaduddin Owaisi, the leader of AIMIM and a four-time member of the Lok Sabha, presents a difficult opponent for Latha. This is the first time a female candidate from the Hyderabad constituency has been fielded by the BJP. The Owaisi family has maintained a stronghold in Hyderabad.\nIt is noteworthy that in 2022, the Sessions Court cleared Akbaruddin of all charges despite his 2013 speech earning him a 40-day jail sentence. This was due to insufficient evidence. The police are accused of providing biassed evidence to protect Akbaruddin, and the case is still being investigated by the High Court.\nOne would wonder why Barrister Owaisi did not bring up his acquittal in the midst of all of this. Maybe the resurfacing of an eleven-year-old grudge doesn\'t affect him too much.\n(With inputs from ANI)\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa\' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says \'Big Fan\' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress\' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina'], 'https://www.dnaindia.com/world/report-trump-musk-nasa-and-spacex-the-fight-over-sunita-williams-return-3137518': ['Trump, Musk, NASA, and SpaceX: The fight over Sunita Williams’ return', 'WORLD\nPresident Donald Trump said he had personally asked Elon Musk for help in bringing astronauts back from the International Space Station.

He also used the moment to criticize President Biden and his administration.\nThe SpaceX Dragon spacecraft, which will bring astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore back to Earth, has been at the space station since September and was always supposed to bring them back home. Even so, Trump mentioned in the Oval Office on Thursday, March 6, that he had given Elon permission a week earlier to bring them back.\nTrump also said that former President Joe Biden felt embarrassed about the situation and decided to leave them there.\nThe astronauts earlier told CNN\'s Anderson Cooper that they don’t feel "stuck" at the space station. However, NASA and the astronauts have struggled to completely dismiss this idea, partly because of the political back-and-forth involving Trump and Musk.\nWilmore reassured Cooper on February 13 that they don’t feel abandoned, stuck, or stranded. He was responding to a question about Trump’s remarks, as reported by USA Today.\nWhat’s the latest with the Starliner?\nAstronauts Wilmore and Williams were chosen for the first crewed flight of the Starliner. In June 2024, they launched on a mission to test the Boeing Starliner, which is designed to eventually carry NASA astronauts to space alongside SpaceX’s Dragon.\nBoth astronauts are highly experienced and are making their third trip to the space station.\nNASA found technical problems with the spacecraft, which delayed the astronauts\' return home. In the end, the space agency had to bring the Starliner back to Earth in early September without its crew.\nThe SpaceX Dragon spacecraft, which will now bring astronauts Williams and Wilmore back to Earth, has been at the space station since late September. It originally arrived with the Crew-9 mission.\nAs part of NASA\'s plan, the spacecraft carried only two astronauts instead of the usual four. This left extra seats available for Williams and Wilmore on the trip back to Earth.\nThe Boeing\xa0 Starliner crew members, Sunita Williams and Barry "Butch" Wilmore, joined the Crew-9 mission, whose astronauts are still completing their full stay in space.\nNASA announced in a mission update that the Dragon capsule, carrying the four astronauts of Crew-10, is set to launch as early as March 12. It will travel on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Kennedy Space Center in Florida, replacing the Crew-9 team.\nAs the name implies, this is the 10th crew rotation mission to the space station under NASA\'s commercial crew program.\nAstronaut Hague said in a news conference from space on Tuesday, March 4, that Crew-9 will pass the mission to Crew-10 before returning to Earth after a successful long stay.\nWhen the new astronauts reach the space station, there will be a few days of handover activities. After that, Williams and Wilmore will join Crew-9 in the SpaceX Dragon to leave the station, possibly around March 25.\nNASA astronaut Nick Hague will lead the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft as it returns to Earth, along with Mission Specialists Suni Williams, Butch Wilmore, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov. The crew practiced on Tuesday, 4th March using Dragon\'s computer tablets and reviewed the steps needed for the spacecraft to move away from the space station and reenter Earth\'s atmosphere before landing in the ocean near Florida. Hague and Gorbunov have been on the station since September 29, 2024, while Williams and Wilmore arrived on June 6.\n\n(The author Girish Linganna of this article is an award-winning Science Writer and a Defence, Aerospace & Political Analyst based in Bengaluru.

She revealed about instances where she had self-doubts on parenting. Being a cosmetologist, she talked about the importance of cosmetology and plastic surgery in Bollywood.\nVaishali Shastri\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 02:28 PM IST\nActress Priyanka Chopra’s mother Madhu Chopra was a doctor in the Indian Army and a cosmetologist. Talking about cosmetology and good looks she said there is a difference between plastic surgery and cosmetology clearing the popular belief that both of them are same. She said, “In plastic surgery you remodel, repair, fix and in cosmetology you take care of skin, nails, hair, body, which is superficial but in surgery you go deep beneath the skin.”\nShe suggests that “cosmetology is the need of the day” as food and the environment are getting poisoned with chemicals and other stuff. She further explains that skin care alone is not enough.\xa0 “I’m all for cosmetology and anti-aging,” she said while supporting anti-aging gracefully. She meant by saying that cosmetology not just makes people look good but transforms them completely by building their confidence. “Skin is that organ of your body that shows how healthy you are, it is the first thing people see, and it is our birthright to look good. Why age with rinkles when you can change your looks.”\nShe said that with such medical facilities one can not only change their looks but transform their persona with confidence. While talking about looks in showbiz, how they matter and why, she said that talent and looks are different and one doesn't need looks to make it big in the film industry, however, looks do give you equal opportunities. “It's the good-looking actors who make it to the mainstream; it is not necessary but one of the hard facts which you have to accept.” “There are many big actors and superstars in Bollywood who don’t have conventional good looks but are minting millions.”\nMadhu Chopra emphasise on the point that good looks give you an extra edge and more confidence in life. “To get equal footing and opportunity. Be it for business or not looking good, feeling good and confident is your birthright.”\nMadhu Chopra bared it all about Priyanka Chopra’s traumatic phases in life, her childhood and more in the interview. While she revealed the reasons Priyanka Chopra was sent to boarding school, she said that it was due to a small reason. “She gave back answer to papa when he called her while she was playing with a doll, ‘can't you see I’m busy’ and I was like, she is speaking my language.”\nSeeing this, Madhu Chopra started self-doubting her parenting and said, “wo hamari bahut laadli thi. But I missed watching her growing up.” (She was our pampered child).\nWhile Madhu Chopra is a confident and supportive mother, at this point of time, she was also doubtful about her parenting.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"], 'https://www.dnaindia.com/education/report-meet-woman-who-studied-12-14-hours-a-day-aced-upsc-examination-on-first-attempt-with-air-3-donuru-ananya-reddy-know-about-her-preparation-strategy-and-more-3133890': ['Meet woman, who studied 12-14 hours a day, aced UPSC examination on first attempt with AIR...; know about her preparation strategy and more', "EDUCATION\nWhile cracking the UPSC Civil Service Examination (CSE) is no easy task, millions of students appear for it every year, carrying dreams to join the administrative field.\nMeemansa Shekhawat\nUpdated : Mar 08, 2025, 12:31 PM IST\nWhile cracking the UPSC Civil Service Examination (CSE) is no easy task, millions of students appear for it every year, carrying dreams to join the administrative field.\nHowever, they are a few who clear the examination and set examples for everyone out there.

According to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the clashes began between government forces and supporters of former President Bashar Assad and later escalated into revenge killings.\nDeadly clashes and retaliation\nThe violence has claimed the lives of at least 745 civilians, including many who were killed at close range. Additionally, 125 government security personnel and 148 militants linked to Assad lost their lives. Large parts of Latakia province have been left without electricity and drinking water as a result of the fighting.\nThe conflict started on Thursday when security forces tried to arrest a wanted individual near Jableh. However, they were ambushed by Assad loyalists, leading to intense clashes, as reported by the Associated Press (AP).\nTargeting of Alawites\nOn Friday, the violence took a dangerous turn when Sunni Muslim gunmen, who support the government, began targeting Alawites, the minority sect to which Assad belongs. The attacks have created a significant challenge for Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the group that played a key role in removing Assad from power.\nResidents described horrifying scenes of brutality in Alawite villages. Ali Sheha, a 57-year-old from Baniyas, told AP, “Bodies were on the streets. The gunmen were less than 100 meters away, firing at homes and residents.” He added that the attackers checked people’s IDs to confirm their sect before killing them.\nInternational reactions\nThe Syrian government has claimed that it has regained control over most of the areas captured by Assad loyalists. Meanwhile, France has strongly condemned the violence. A statement from the French foreign ministry said, “Paris condemns in the strongest possible terms atrocities committed against civilians on religious grounds.”\nThousands of Alawites have fled their homes, with many seeking shelter at Russia’s Hmeimim airbase. Lebanese legislator Haidar Nasser urged the international community to protect Alawites, stating, “The international community should protect Alawites, who are Syrian citizens loyal to their country.”\nAs tensions remain high, the situation in Syria continues to be fragile, with fears of further violence and instability.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"], 'https://www.dnaindia.com/web-stories/lifestyle/easy-morning-rituals-to-keep-your-brain-healthy-and-stressfree-all-day-1741342565471': 'Error: Could not find an article body', 'https://www.dnaindia.com/hindi/latest-news': ['शादी समारोह में स्वर्ग से उतरे दूल्हे के दिवगंत पिता, खाना खाया और विदा हो गए, AI का कमाल देख भावुक हुए बाराती', "LATEST-NEWS\n'UP में माफिया भी करते थे...'

Uorfi mentioned that Dhanashree is currently going through a tough time in her life.\nDhanashree has faced constant trolling on social media amid her divorce from Yuzvendra. In a recent podcast with Humans of Bombay, Uorfi talked about how women are often blamed in controversies involving male athletes. The social media influencer highlighted her steadfast support for Dhanashree, having written a detailed post defending her during the ongoing online criticism. Afterward, Dhanashree personally reached out to Uorfi to express her thanks.\n“I had posted a story in support of her, because I thought she was being treated very unfairly. She reached out to me and thanked me for the support as she was going through a very difficult time," Uorfi said.\nIn her initial post, Uorfi penned a lengthy note discussing the divorce of Natasa Stankovic and Hardik Pandya. She also touched upon the past criticism Anushka Sharma faced for Virat Kohli\'s performance in matches. Although not explicitly naming Dhanashree or Yuzvendra, Uorfi\'s Instagram story alluded to them.\n“Everytime a cricketer is breaking up or getting divorced, the woman is bashed left right and centre just because in our head our cricketer is our hero. None of us have any idea what happened between the two or even during Natasha and Hardik’s case but of course it’s the woman who is at fault."\n“Oh and don’t forget the time when Anushka was blamed for Virat’s bad performances. Remember? So it’s always the woman who is to be blamed for the man’s action? These are grown men with fully functioning brains who know what they are doing."\nUorfi Javed also remarked on the tendency to blame cricketers\' wives for marrying for financial gain when their marriages encounter difficulties.\n“In our minds, the cricketers are the heroes and they never do anything wrong. Is the cricketer not a sensible person? Couldn’t he tell if the girl had married him for the money?," she said.\nMeanwhile, both Dhanashree Verma and Yuzvendra Chahal have not publicly commented on the situation. According to a recent report, it was revealed during a court hearing that the couple has been living separately for the past 18 months. When questioned about the reason for their divorce, they cited \'compatibility issues\'.\nThere have been multiple reports circulating that Dhanashree was requesting Rs 60 crore in alimony from the cricketer. However, Dhanashree\'s family has since released an official statement dismissing these claims.\nAlso read| How much money does Mohammed Shami provide to Hasin Jahan as maintenance?

The latest infection involves a two-year-old child from Rajasthan who was admitted to a private hospital in Ahmedabad's Chandkheda after exhibiting symptoms of cold and cough. The child is currently stable, according to civic officials.\n\r\n\tThis report follows the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare's announcement earlier on Monday regarding two confirmed HMPV cases involving infants in Bengaluru. A three-month-old girl and an eight-month-old boy were diagnosed with HMPV during routine surveillance; both had a history of bronchopneumonia, which is a serious lung infection affecting the alveoli and bronchi.\n\nWhy is HMPV Impacting Children?\n\r\n\tHMPV significantly affects children due to its link with severe respiratory illnesses, particularly among young and vulnerable populations. It is a leading cause of acute respiratory infections, accounting for approximately 10 per cent to 12 per cent of such illnesses in children. While most cases are mild, around 5\xa0per cent to 16 per cent of affected children may develop serious conditions like pneumonia or bronchiolitis, which often require hospitalisation.\n\r\n\tThe heightened risk for children, especially infants and toddlers, stems from their lack of pre-existing immunity to HMPV. The initial infection usually results in more severe symptoms, while subsequent infections tend to be milder as some immunity develops. The most severe cases typically occur in children aged 6 to 12 months.\n\r\n\tChildren with underlying health issues, such as asthma or those born prematurely, face an increased risk of severe complications from HMPV infections. Research indicates that HMPV can worsen asthma symptoms, leading to hospitalizations and the need for respiratory support.\n\r\n\tHMPV spreads easily through respiratory droplets and can also be transmitted via contact with contaminated surfaces. This high contagion rate contributes to its rapid spread among children, particularly in communal settings like daycare centers.\n\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"], 'https://www.dnaindia.com/education/report-meet-woman-who-left-her-rs-23-lakh-job-at-wipro-later-cracked-upsc-exam-with-air-28-she-is-kajal-jawla-3135918': ['Meet woman, who left her Rs 23 lakh job at Wipro, later cracked UPSC exam with AIR..., she is...', "EDUCATION\nUPSC Civil Service Examination (CSE), deemed one of the toughest tests in the country, is a dream to millions!

Through a detailed thread on X (formerly Twitter), Johnson introduced his new app and urged people to join the movement to become those who will be “admired and respected” by the 25th century.\nWhat is \'Don’t Die\'?\r\n\tJohnson explained that "Don’t Die" is not just an ideology but a framework for transitioning into the era of AI while focusing on longevity and wellness. He stated, "Don’t Die becomes history\'s fastest-growing ideology. It saves the human race and ushers in an existence more spectacular than we can imagine. It is inevitable. The only question is: will you be an early or late adopter?"\nOn a personal level, Johnson shared that he has been living by the "Don’t Die" principles for years. This includes maintaining a healthy lifestyle by eating well, exercising regularly, and managing stress. He also focuses on improving his body\'s health through scientific measurement and protocols. Johnson claims that these practices have given him "the slowest aging speed in recorded history."\nWhy Now?\r\n\tJohnson revealed that his inspiration came from a thought experiment where he imagined himself interacting with people from the 25th century. He believed they would view "Don’t Die" as the key to how humanity saved itself and merged with AI. To turn this idea into a global movement, he invited people to become "Don’t Die Citizens" by downloading the app, tracking their "Don’t Die Score," connecting with others, and starting local communities.\nMixed Reactions on Social Media\r\n\tJohnson’s post received mixed reactions. Some expressed enthusiasm, with one user saying they would organize meetups and activities for "Don’t Die" in Michigan. Others were skeptical, questioning whether the new "religion" would cost money or if it was better described as a movement rather than a religion.\nOne user commented, “It’s a mistake to call it a religion as most people already have one and don’t believe in having two. Better to call it a movement, ideology, something else that isn’t generally considered mutually exclusive.” Another joked, “My knee literally won’t stop jerking,” referring to Johnson\'s request to hold back a knee-jerk reaction.\nBryan Johnson\'s Journey\r\n\tBryan Johnson, founder and CEO of Kernel Holding SA, gained global attention after Bloomberg published an article titled “How to Be 18 Years Old Again for Only $2 Million a Year.” Since then, he has been openly documenting his journey to reverse aging, often stating his ultimate goal: to not die.\nJohnson\'s vision for "Don’t Die" is to merge scientific wellness practices with AI-driven advancements, offering a pathway to a healthier, longer life and possibly the future of humanity. Whether this idea will gain widespread acceptance or remain a niche movement is yet to be seen.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa\' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says \'Big Fan\' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress\' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina'], 'https://www.dnaindia.com/web-stories/viral/5-tallest-buildings-in-india-1741527980824': 'Error: Could not find an article body', 'https://www.dnaindia.com/business/report-mukesh-ambani-s-superhit-reliance-jio-plans-under-rs-300-unlimited-calls-100-sms-15gb-of-4g-data-jiocloud-and-other-benefits-3137706': ["Mukesh Ambani's SUPERHIT Reliance Jio plans under Rs 300: Unlimited calls, 100 SMS, 1.5GB of 4G data, JioCloud and other benefits", "BUSINESS\nThese plans are ideal for users with moderate data needs who appreciate additional services like streaming and cloud storage.\nSonali Sharma\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 03:44 PM IST\nReliance Jio, India’s largest telecom operator, founded by Mukesh Ambani, has transformed how Indians use smartphones.

The outbreak has led to 12 fatalities, including six confirmed deaths and six suspected cases, according to state health authorities.\nOf the reported cases, 179 patients have recovered and been discharged. However, 24 individuals remain in intensive care, with 15 requiring ventilator support. The cases are spread across multiple regions, including Pune Municipal Corporation, recently added villages, Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation, Pune Rural, and other districts.\nHealth officials are closely monitoring the situation and have urged medical facilities to remain vigilant. The Guillain-Barre Syndrome is a rare neurological disorder that can cause muscle weakness and paralysis, often triggered by infections. While most patients recover with timely medical intervention, severe cases may require prolonged hospitalisation and ventilatory support.\nThe state government has intensified surveillance efforts and is coordinating with hospitals to ensure adequate treatment and resources for affected patients. Public health advisories have been issued to raise awareness about early symptoms and the importance of seeking immediate medical attention. In response to the rising cases of Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) in Maharashtra, the Public Health Department has implemented several measures to contain the outbreak and prevent further spread.\nA state-level rapid response team was immediately dispatched to the affected areas to assess the situation and coordinate mitigation efforts.Authorities in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and Pune Rural have been directed to strengthen surveillance activities.As part of the ongoing investigation, 7,262 water samples from different parts of the city have been sent to the Public Health Laboratory for chemical and biological analysis.\nSo far, contamination has been detected in 144 water sources, prompting necessary corrective actions. Additionally, intensified health promotion activities have been initiated to raise public awareness.\nThe government has also appealed to private medical practitioners to report any suspected GBS cases to the respective public health authorities for timely intervention. To enhance monitoring, house-to-house surveillance has been carried out across multiple regions, covering 89,699 households--46,534 in the Pune Municipal Corporation, 29,209 in the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC), and 13,956 in the Pune Rural.\nMeanwhile, 82 serum samples have been sent to the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS) in Bengaluru for Antiganglioside antibody testing, which is crucial for diagnosing and understanding the outbreak's underlying causes. The state health department has assured the public that it is fully prepared to implement preventive and control measures and urged citizens not to panic.\nAuthorities are continuing to monitor the situation closely while coordinating with hospitals to ensure adequate medical care for affected patients. In light of the ongoing Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) outbreak in Maharashtra, the state's Public Health Department has issued guidelines urging citizens to take preventive measures and maintain hygiene to reduce the risk of infection.\nAuthorities have advised residents to ensure water quality by drinking only boiled water and consuming fresh, clean food. To minimize health risks, the public has been warned against eating stale or partially cooked food, particularly chicken and mutton.\nThe health department has reassured citizens that the situation is under control and has urged people not to panic. Anyone experiencing symptoms suggestive of GBS is encouraged to seek medical attention at government hospitals without delay.\nOfficials have also requested that citizens refrain from sending water samples for independent testing. Instead, individuals seeking water quality assessments or information related to GBS should contact the Pune Municipal Corporation's designated helplines. The state government continues to monitor the situation closely, reinforcing surveillance and medical response measures to contain the outbreak and ensure public safety.\n(This story has not been edited by DNA staff and is published from ANI)\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"], 'https://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-up-cm-yogi-adityanath-reacts-to-sambhal-officer-holi-namaz-remark-can-pray-at-3137675': ["UP CM Yogi Adityanath reacts to Sambhal officer's Holi-Namaz remark: 'Can pray at...'", "INDIA\nThe officer had said that while Holi is celebrated once a year, Friday prayers happen every week.

The complaint also accused the company of promoting a harmful product, gutkha, which is a mix of pan masala and tobacco, under the false impression that it contains saffron.\nThe notices were issued by Commission Chairman Gyarsilal Meena and member Hemlata Agarwal, following a complaint filed by consumer rights activist Yogendra Singh Badiyal. The complaint alleged that JB Industries falsely claimed that every grain of Vimal Pan Masala contains saffron, which is highly unlikely given the significant price difference between saffron and the pan masala product. Saffron costs around Rs 4 lakh per kilogram, while the pan masala pouch is sold for just Rs 5.\nThe petitioner argued that this misleading advertisement is intended to deceive consumers into buying the product, which poses serious health risks due to the presence of tobacco.\nMeanwhile, the actors have not yet issued any statement in connection to the legal trouble.\xa0Earlier, the actors have long faced criticism for endorsing pan masalas, with Ajay, Shah Rukh Khan, and Akshay Kumar being among those who have faced severe backlash for their involvement in pan masala advertisements. Akshay Kumar, in particular, had faced intense scrutiny for featuring in a pan masala ad, prompting him to issue an unconditional apology for hurting his fans' sentiments.

A section of social media users recently accused the Korean singer of plagiarism after her song Like Jennie sounded similar to that of Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani\'s title anthem, Rani\'s Intro Theme, which introduced Alia Bhatt\'s character Rani, in the movie.\nPritam, who composed the music for the 2023 film also starring Ranveer Singh, shared a lengthy note on his Instagram handle on Friday and said that some similarities tend to happen in music. He noted that even the name of the artist and Bhatt\'s character in the film sound similar. "Rani and Jennie are names that rhyme, so a similar flow in one phrase doesn’t make it a copy. In music, minor similarities are bound to happen—whether through rhymes, phrasing, or even within the same genre," he wrote.\nHe further added, "Instead of focusing on tiny details, it’s important to see the bigger picture. In today’s interconnected world, where artists share the same platforms, no one is deliberately trying to copy someone else’s work. Creating a song takes immense effort, and if an artist truly resonates with an idea, they can simply collaborate."\nThe 53-year-old composer, whose credits include blockbuster songs such as Kesariya, Tum Se Hi, Badtameez Dil, Tu Hi Meri Shab Hai, and Channa Mereya among others, also said that coincidences tend to happen in creative process. "Music is about creativity, unique artistic perspective, influence, and sometimes pure coincidence - especially when arists exit on the same creative wavelength. Rather than tearing artist down, celebrating their work makes far more sense. Wishing Jennie all the best for her new album", he concluded. Like Jennie is a track from Jennie\'s latest album Ruby, that comprises 15 songs in total.\nA post shared by Pritam (@ipritamofficial)\nPritam\'s soundtrack for Rocky Aur Ranii Ki Prem Kahaani was highly appreciated with songs such as Tum Kya Mile, Dhindhora Baaje Re, Ve Kamleya, and What Jhumka becoming chartbusters.

The film also includes influencer Apoorva Makhija, who is currently embroiled in a controversy surrounding India\'s Got Latent show. Interestingly, the cast members have not tagged Apoorva in their social media posts, sparking speculation about whether this was a deliberate snub or a decision made by her team.\nWas Apoorva Makhija deliberately snubbed from Nadaaniyan?\nApoorva\'s absence from the film\'s premiere and her silence on social media about her role in the movie had sparked curiosity. Adding to the mystery, the cast members had not tagged her in their posts, amidst her ongoing legal issues. Her co-star Agasthya Shah shared behind-the-scenes photos from the film\'s set on Instagram, tagging Ibrahim Ali Khan, Khushi Kapoor, and others. Notably, one of the images featured Apoorva, but she was conspicuously left out of the tags. Even other cast members including Neel, Aaliyah, and Dev, shared a group photo from the film\'s set, but none of them tagged Apoorva.\nFans spotted her in the image and began questioning why she wasn\'t tagged.Comments flooded in, with some expressing delight at seeing her, such as "Finally saw Apoorva after a long time". Others wondered why she wasn\'t tagged, with comments like "Oh, she didn’t tag the Rebel kid", "Why isn’t Apoorva tagged?", "Rebel absence is just not so done", and "Why is no one tagging Rebel Kid?". However, the mystery was solved when a fan revealed that Apoorva had turned off Instagram\'s tagging feature, preventing anyone from tagging her in posts. This move is likely an attempt to avoid unwanted negativity and harassment on social media amid her ongoing controversy.\n\nApoorva Makhija\'s controversy\nApoorva is currently embroiled in controversy surrounding Ranveer Allahbadia\'s comments on Samay Raina\'s show, India\'s Got Latent.

This match also marks the conclusion of their home leg in Lucknow, and they are eager to end their disappointing campaign on a positive note. Unfortunately, the Warriorz were knocked out of the playoffs race after the results from Friday night, with the Gujarat Giants securing eight points. This situation has also placed the Royal Challengers Bengaluru in a must-win scenario following a string of losses during their home leg.\nThe Indian players, especially in batting, have faced challenges for the Warriorz, with Grace Harris, Georgia Voll, Chinelle Henry, and Sophie Ecclestone all needing to elevate their game. While Uma Chetry, Vrinda Dinesh, and Kiran Navgire have shown potential, their performances haven't been sufficient to back up the overseas stars. Even captain Deepti Sharma has struggled to make a significant impact.\nOn the flip side, RCB is counting on captain Smriti Mandhana to guide the team to victory. The team's reliance on Ellyse Perry has revealed vulnerabilities in the lineup, particularly with some key players absent. Sneh Rana and Kim Garth, stepping in as replacements, have done well, but RCB needs their top players to rise to the occasion. RCB must secure wins in two consecutive matches to compete with the Giants and the Mumbai Indians for a playoff spot. Thus, the upcoming match against the UP Warriorz is vital for the defending champions as they wrap up their league stage at the CCI against Mumbai.\nLive Streaming Details\nThe Women's Premier League (WPL) 2025 match between UP Warriorz and Royal Challengers Bengaluru is scheduled to take place on Saturday, March 8. The match will be held at the Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow , with kick-off set for 7:30 PM IST. Fans can catch all the action live on the Sports18 Network, for those unable to watch on TV, the match will also be available for live streaming on the JioCinema app and website.\nPitch report\nIn the matches played at the venue, Gujarat scored the highest score of 186 in the first game. The subsequent games saw a decrease in total scores, with UP scoring 150 and Gujarat chasing a total of 177 in the following match. Lucknow has hosted three games, with the 150-run mark being surpassed in five out of six innings. Spinners have been more successful than fast bowlers, with a better average and economy rate compared to seamers.\nWeather report\nThe weather at Ekana Stadium will be warm with hazy sunshine, temperatures around 32 degrees, and a RealFeel of 33 degrees. However, the air quality will be very unhealthy.

The president made his case for his reciprocal tariffs, which will commence April 2. He wants to impose the same tariff on imports from foreign countries as those nations impose on US exports. "Other countries have used tariffs against us for decades and now it\'s our turn to start using them against those other countries. On average, the European Union, China, Brazil, India, - Mexico and Canada - Have you heard of them -and countless other nations charge us tremendously higher tariffs than we charge them. It\'s very unfair,” Trump said Tuesday night in an address to the Joint Session of the Congress, the first of his second term in the White House.\n\r\n\t"India charges us auto tariffs higher than 100%," he continued. In February, President Trump has said that his administration will “soon” impose reciprocal tariffs on countries such as India and China, reiterating what he had said during Prime Minister Narendra Modi\'s visit to the US capital last month.\n\r\n\tTrump has made it clear to Prime Minister Modi that India will not be spared from Washington\'s reciprocal tariffs and emphasised that “nobody can argue with me” on tariff structure.\n\r\n\t"China\'s average tariff on our products is twice... And South Korea\'s average tariff is four times higher. Think of that, four times higher. And we give so much help militarily and in so many other ways to South Korea. But that\'s what happens. This is happening by friend and foe. This system is not fair to the United States. It never was,” he said.\n\r\n\tTrump added that from April 2, reciprocal tariffs will kick in, and whatever “they tariff us, other countries, we will tariff them. That\'s reciprocal back and forth. Whatever they tax us, we will tax them. If they do non-monetary tariffs to keep us out of their market, then we will do non-monetary barriers to keep them out of our market.\n\r\n\t"They don\'t even allow us in their market.

Her Instagram video, featuring her husband Tim Fischer, has generated significant online discussion.\nTaking to the Instagram, Kristen Fischer wrote, "There are many things that are commonplace in India that are pretty unheard of in America. Here are a few things we have noticed are normal in India but would make any American very uncomfortable."\nKristen highlighted that Americans are accustomed to using toilet paper and often find the concept of utilising a jet spray disconcerting.\xa0"The thought of getting wet while using the toilet makes them uncomfortable," she wrote.\nShe also touched upon the practice of sharing slippers in many Indian households, where guests are offered communal chappals. According to Kristen, Americans find this concept unthinkable. Similarly, the idea of sharing a water bottle is considered unhygienic in the US, where people usually prefer to have their own.\nA post shared by Kristen Fischer (@kristenfischer3)\nKristen highlighted how food culture differs significantly between the two countries. In India, it is common for one person to order food for the entire table, and everyone shares. However, Americans usually prefer individual portions and are not comfortable sharing their meals.\nShe also discussed the Indian practice of eating with hands, which is common in India but less so in the US, where utensils are the norm. This sparked a debate among viewers, with some defending the traditional Indian way of eating, claiming it enhances the flavor of food.\nKristen also highlighted a significant difference in road safety practices, noting the lack of strict car seat regulations in India. She observed that Americans would find it unsettling to see children sitting on laps instead of being secured in a five-point safety harness.\nIn her video, Kristen Fischer highlighted the cultural differences between India and the United States, specifically regarding child-rearing practices and family structures. She noted that co-sleeping with children is common in India, while American parents typically prefer separate rooms for their kids. Additionally, she observed that living with in-laws after marriage is a rare occurrence in America, whereas joint families are prevalent in India.\nSince its posting, Fischer\'s video has garnered significant attention, amassing over 20,000 likes and nearly 800,000 views. The video has sparked a range of reactions from social media users. Some have defended Indian traditions, while others have found the cultural differences amusing. Several users have also expressed appreciation for the video\'s insightful portrayal of cultural contrasts.\nA user said,\xa0"It’s kind of funny that Americans feel that way - though they eat sandwiches, pizza, fries, burgers, fried chicken etc. with their hands!"\nAnother user requested to respect both the cultures as she said,\xa0"Both India and the USA have unique cultures, each with its own strengths. India’s emphasis on community fosters strong family bonds, while the USA’s focus on individualism drives innovation.

Despite setbacks and hardhips, Pareek clinched an AIR 884 in UPSC Civil Service Exam (CSE) - deemed one of the toughest examinations in the country - and made his family proud.\nIn this article, we will talk about the journey of the IAS officer.\nWho is Hemant Pareek?\nHemant Pareek was raised in a destitute household in Rajasthan.

Later, the family relocated to Haryana, where her mother worked on private lands to earn money.\nOnce, a contractor refused to pay Rs 220 to Pareek\'s mother. When he went to him to enquire about the same, he mocked him and said, "Are you a collector"? This humiliation filled Pareek with the determination to become an IAS officer.\nHowever, it was later fueled as he was made fun of by a few college mates, when he told them that he wanted to become an IAS officer.\nEducation\nHemant Pareek pursued his primary schooling from Maharshi Dayanand School, Hanumangarh, Rajasthan.

They tied the knot on this day in 1985. Over the years, they have become some of the most influential figures in India.\nAs they celebrate 40 years together, it’s worth noting that Nita Ambani is not only the wife of businessman Mukesh Ambani but also the chairperson and founder of the Reliance Foundation. Her personality and philanthropic work even impressed Mukesh’s father, who chose her as the perfect match for his son.\nOn the occasion of Nita Ambani’s 60th birthday, let’s look back at how their love story began and how the two eventually got married.\nIt sounds like something from a fairy tale when Mukesh and Nita Ambani first meet. The renowned Reliance founder Dhirubhai Ambani first saw Nita when she was performing Bharatnatyam at a cultural event. He was struck by her grace and talent and thought she would be a perfect match for his son, Mukesh. He personally contacted Nita and suggested a meeting with Mukesh, taking everything into his own hands. This simple suggestion set the stage for what would later become an iconic love story.\nAs Mukesh and Nita spent more time together, their bond deepened. In a memorable moment that cemented their relationship, Mukesh made a spontaneous yet powerful proposal to Nita. One day when they were driving, Mukesh pulled to a stop at a light, turned to face Nita, and proposed marriage.\xa0 Nita hesitated, taken aback by the sudden proposition.\xa0 Then, in jest, Mukesh threatened to stop starting the car until she responded.\xa0 This lighthearted yet sincere gesture won Nita’s heart, and she said yes, beginning a partnership that has flourished over the years.\nMukesh and Nita have consistently supported one another as a relationship.\xa0 Nita oversaw a number of important projects in the fields of sports, healthcare, and education when Mukesh assumed control of Reliance Industries. She was instrumental in the formation of the Mumbai Indians IPL cricket team and rose to become the chairman of the Dhirubhai Ambani International School. Through her work with the Reliance Foundation, Nita has promoted several charitable initiatives throughout India, demonstrating her dedication to the community.\nAs they celebrate their 40th wedding anniversary, Nita Ambani and Mukesh Ambani continue to inspire, showing how a deep connection and a shared commitment to family and community can create an enduring legacy.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"], 'https://www.dnaindia.com/viral/report-us-millionaire-bryan-johnson-reveals-why-he-avoids-coffee-other-stimulants-my-mood-is-just-stable-all-day-long-3137758': ["US millionaire Bryan Johnson reveals why he avoids coffee, other stimulants: 'My mood is just...'", 'VIRAL\nJohnson recently introduced his new ideology \'Don\'t Die\', which he believes is the key to human survival and aligns AI with humanity\'s best interests.\nPrashant Tamta\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 06:32 PM IST\nBryan Johnson is known for his unconventional lifestyle choices.

Among her many prized jewels, one gemstone holds a special place in her heart — the emerald. But for Nita Ambani, this dazzling green gem is more than just an accessory; it is believed to bring good luck, prosperity, and positivity.\nIn astrology, emerald, known as ‘panna’ in Hindi, is associated with financial stability, health benefits, and good fortune. Many believe that wearing an emerald can attract wealth and success, making it a powerful symbol of abundance. It is also linked to Goddess Lakshmi, the deity of prosperity, further enhancing its spiritual significance.\nEmeralds have been valued throughout history, particularly in Indian culture. Ancient rulers and Mughal emperors admired their rich green color and mystical properties. In Western traditions, emeralds are connected to Venus, the Roman goddess of love and beauty, symbolizing nature, fertility, and eternal youth.\nBeyond its cultural and spiritual significance, emeralds are also believed to have health benefits. Some say the gemstone can help reduce eye problems and bring emotional balance. It is also thought to drive away negativity, replacing it with peace and positivity.\nMany people admire Nita Ambani’s success and see her love for emeralds as a reflection of her belief in their positive energy.

However, an official confirmation is still awaited. The show began as Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives centered around the lives Neelam Kothari, Maheep Kapoor, Bhavana Pandey and Seema Kiran Sajdeh, wives of Samir Soni, Sanjay Kapoor, Chunky Panday, and Sohail Khan (now divorced). The third season had three Delhi socialites Shalini Passi, Riddhima Kapoor Sahni, and Kalyani Saha Chawla joining the cast.\nA source was quoted telling IANS, "We heard Sunita Ahuja is going to be considered for the upcoming season of the Fabulous Lives vs Bollywood Wives.

It was only after facing the heat of struggle that their luck shone and they became successful. One such actor is Nana Patekar, who made his acting debut in Bollywood with the 1978 drama Gaman and laboured both professionally and personally to be as successful as he is today. Based on his hard work and dedication, Nana Patekar not only made his place in Bollywood but also received a lot of respect from his fans and peers. Nana Patekar has also been awarded the National Award thrice and was also given the Padma Shri award for his dedication to the field of Films and Arts in 2013.\nHowever, all these achievements did not come overnight. Many people are unaware that there was a time when Nana Patekar used to work for just Rs 35. During his years of struggle, Nana Patekar took up a job painting movie posters in Chunabhatti, walking 8 kilometers daily for a modest monthly wage of Rs 35.\nNot only was Nana Patekar's young adulthood, but his childhood was also spent in extreme poverty, thanks to a trusted acquaintance who deceitfully took over the family business.\nIn an interview with Siddharth Kannan, Nana Patekar said that the circumstances of the family had a deep impact on him and he grew up at a young age. He started working at the age of just 13. Nana Patekar also shared how, while doing small jobs, he started doing theatre and from there his journey to Bollywood began.\nNana Patekar made his debut with Gaman but his breakthrough came after the release of the 1986 sleeper hit Ankush. Over the years, Nana Patekar worked in several memorable films including Parinda, Tirangaaa, Krantiveer, Agni Sakshi, Khamoshi, and Bhoot.\nOne of his most special films was Karisma Kapoor and Sanjay Kapoor starrer Shakti, which was released in 2002, in which he played the role of Karisma Kapoor's father-in-law. Shah Rukh Khan also made an appearance in this film.\nAs for his personal life, Nana Patekar married Neelkanti at age 27. When he turned 28, Nana Patekar's father died of a heart attack and later he also lost his first son.\nNana Patekar likes to lead a simple life, away from the limelight but has successfully established himself financially, securing his and his family's futures. As per media reports, Nana Patekar's estimated net worth is Rs 80 crore. He also charges Rs 2-3 crore per film.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"], 'https://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-dna-tv-show-analysis-of-child-traffickers-modus-operandi-in-delhi-3084449': ["DNA TV Show: Analysis of child traffickers' modus operandi in Delhi", "INDIA\nThe CBI conducted raids in several locations in Delhi and Haryana on Friday night in response to a tip.\nSonali Sharma\nUpdated : Apr 07, 2024, 12:18 AM IST\nTwo newborns, one who was 15 days old and the other who was just two days old, were saved after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) busted a syndicate of child traffickers on Friday night. Seven people were detained by the agency for their involvement in the sale of newborns to childless couples via Facebook and WhatsApp advertisements.\nUnder the operation, CBI conducted searches at seven locations across Delhi and Haryana.\nIn today's DNA, Zee News anchor Ram Mohan Sharma analysed the 'Modus Operandi' of the child traffic racket in the national capital.\nThe CBI conducted raids in several locations in Delhi and Haryana on Friday night in response to a tip. Three newborns were rescued and seven people were taken into custody from a house in Delhi's Keshavpuram neighbourhood. Two boys, one and a half days and fifteen days old, respectively, and a baby girl, approximately one-month-old, are among them. These babies were either taken from various locations or obtained for sale, according to CBI authorities, who also said that the buyers and the woman who helped with the transactions were among the people arrested.\nThe accused were presented in court, and seven of the accused were remanded to the custody of the CBI.\xa0 The masterminds of this illegal network are Indu and Neeraj, according to the agency. According to reports, this network obtained infants from hospitalised parents or surrogate mothers and then used Facebook and WhatsApp to find possible adoptive parents. After that, they would forge adoption paperwork to make it easier to sell these kids.\nAccording to the CBI, this group sold infants for between Rs 4 and Rs 6 lakh on the illicit market, treating them like commodities. According to sources, this group has probably trafficked ten or so infants in the last month. Furthermore, the network's activities extend beyond the Delhi NCR area, involving staff members from other prestigious hospitals in different states. More shockingly, the mastermind of this gang has been identified as a government official, purportedly an Assistant Labour Commissioner.\nThe CBI notes that it is still conducting its probe into this child trafficking network and anticipates learning further information. It is expected that other people connected to different hospitals would be taken into custody, as several people, including a hospital ward boy, have already been arrested. It's unclear how far this syndicate has spread, but more arrests are probably on the way.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"], 'https://www.dnaindia.com/india/video-lok-sabha-elections-2024-congress-rahul-gandhi-amethi-suspense-making-bjp-nervous-uttar-pradesh-3087632': ['Lok Sabha Elections 2024 Congress Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous | Uttar Pradesh', "INDIA\nLok Sabha Election 2024 Uttar Pradesh: Raebareli and Amethi Lok Sabha seats are recorded as Congress strongholds in the electoral history of India.

Among the teams competing for glory, the Chennai Super Kings are in the spotlight, aiming to outdo the Mumbai Indians and claim their 6th IPL championship. A key figure in this narrative is the legendary MS Dhoni, who, at 43 years old, will be participating in his 18th tournament.

In the lead-up to the match, a lot of the discussion has centered on the future of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli in the ODI format. The experienced pair retired from T20Is after their World Cup win last year, leading to speculation that a Champions Trophy victory might lead one or both of them to think about stepping away from the game.\nAt the pre-match press conference, Shubman Gill, Rohit\'s deputy, was asked about any conversations regarding the potential retirement of the Indian captains within the team. Gill made it clear that retirement discussions have not been a priority in the team setting. Instead, the focus has been entirely on devising a strategy to secure a win in the upcoming Champions Trophy match.\n"All discussions are on how to win the Champions Trophy. About this decision (Rohit\'s retirement) there has been no talks in the team or with me. I don\'t think Rohit bhai is also thinking about it. After the match, he will think if there is anything"\nBoth Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli are currently showing strong performances in the format, but there’s talk in the cricketing community that if India wins the Champions Trophy, one or both of these talented batters might think about retiring.\nMeanwhile, Shubman Gill has shared his appreciation for being part of such a strong batting line-up, mentioning that the depth in their order allows the top three to play with more freedom and confidence.\n"This is the best batting line up I am part of. Rohit is one of the best openers (in the world) and Virat, we need not tell about him. But our team has depth in batting and that allows the top order to bat with bit more freedom," Shubman Gill said.\nIn regards to the upcoming match, Shubman Gill expressed confidence that they will emerge victorious, unlike the 2023 ODI World Cup where they were defeated by Australia.

Her honest reflections on their relationship, their creative collaborations, and the dynamics of their family are as inspiring as they are thought-provoking.\nWhen asked about her parents\' reaction to her decision to marry Aamir Khan, Kiran was refreshingly honest. "It was a shocker for them," she admitted in an interview with ANI. "They were taken aback. In their eyes, I had a lot of promise. I was someone who wanted to do a lot of things, and they were worried that I might be overshadowed by Aamir\'s larger-than-life persona," she added.\nIndeed, Aamir Khan\'s fame can be overwhelming, and Kiran with her independent spirit, felt the pressure. But what she found most comforting was Aamir\'s acceptance of her as her own person. "Aamir has never expected me to be a certain way. He has always been happy for me to be myself, and that\'s one of the greatest things about him," Kiran shared.\nReflecting on the recent wedding of Aamir\'s daughter, Ira Khan, to Nupur Shikhare, Kiran shared beautiful insights about their blended family. Kiran, who has always been incredibly close to Aamir\'s children from his first marriage, sees their bond as an organic result of the kindness and warmth Aamir fosters in his family. "His family is incredibly warm. So it happens quite organically," she said. "His friends, who\'ve known him since childhood, have become family. Once introduced to the family, those relationships continue to stay strong, even as individuals," she explained.\nFor Kiran, the key to their family dynamic has been acceptance and unconditional support. "The family accepts you as a person, not just in a role," she added, emphasizing that both her and Aamir\'s children--his son Junaid and daughter Ira--have grown up with a sense of inclusion and love. It\'s a family that extends beyond blood ties, with even Nupur Shikhare, Ira\'s husband, becoming part of the larger family fabric.\nBut Kiran\'s journey has not always been easy. The initial challenge of being in the shadow of Aamir Khan\'s fame was real. The weight of public expectation, combined with the pressure to maintain her identity, was a constant struggle as she said, "When you marry someone incredibly famous, you do lose a part of your own identity," Kiran confessed, adding, "It took me a long time to find my own voice again."\nFor Kiran, regaining her sense of self wasn\'t just about public recognition but also about personal fulfillment. She admitted that it was only after some time that she could step out of Aamir\'s shadow and feel comfortable in her own identity. "It wasn\'t just about reclaiming my public identity, but also about personal terms. Aamir allowed me to grow into my own person, to evolve, and it was because of him that I found the courage to say, \'I love you, I love this family, but I need to be on my own.\'"\nDespite their separation in 2021, Kiran and Aamir have maintained a respectful and supportive relationship, both personally and professionally. "We have been able to work together creatively. It shows maturity on both our parts. It\'s not always easy - creative work can get heated - but that\'s what makes the collaboration so fulfilling," Kiran explained.\nKiran\'s own film production company, Kindling Pictures, has already made its mark, producing Laapataa Ladies. However, she continues to work with Aamir Khan Productions, underscoring their ongoing professional camaraderie. "Aamir and I will always be there for each other," she concluded, reflecting on their ability to balance family, career, and creativity without acrimony.\nKiran Rao, Indian film producer and director, was married to Bollywood superstar Aamir Khan for over 15 years. The couple tied the knot in 2005 and had a son, Azad Rao Khan, in 2011. However, in July 2021, they announced their separation and decision to divorce, citing a desire to continue their individual journeys and co-parent their son. Despite their divorce, both Kiran and Aamir have maintained a cordial relationship and continue to support each other\'s professional endeavors.\nExcept for the headline, this story has not been edited by DNA staff and is published from ANI\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa\' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says \'Big Fan\' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress\' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina'], 'https://www.dnaindia.com/world/report-emmanuel-macron-france-hits-big-jackpot-discovers-world-largest-deposit-of-hydrogen-it-is-worth-3137591': ["Emmanuel Macron's France hits big JACKPOT, discovers world’s largest deposit of..., it is worth...", "WORLD\nThe massive deposit, located beneath the soil of Folswiller in the Moselle region, is estimated to hold 46 million tonnes of hydrogen\nShivam Verma\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 09:01 AM IST\nFrance has made a big discovery in green energy with the largest known natural hydrogen reserve on the planet. The massive deposit, located beneath the soil of Folswiller in the Moselle region, is estimated to hold 46 million tonnes of hydrogen. According to reports, the value of this reserve is around $92 trillion, with expectations that its worth will rise in the future.\nThis discovery, made by researchers from the Georesources Laboratory and CNRS, was unexpected.\nScientists were originally searching for methane but instead found an enormous supply of white hydrogen buried 1,250 meters underground. This form of hydrogen is a potential game-changer as it provides a clean energy source without carbon emissions.\nUnlike green hydrogen, which requires electricity from renewable sources for production, or grey hydrogen, which is derived from fossil fuels and contributes to pollution, white hydrogen is naturally occurring.

Let's get to discover it further.\nMeemansa Shekhawat\nUpdated : Jan 31, 2025, 04:04 PM IST\nIn India, wearing Saree and Petticoat is deeply ingrained in our culture and fashion. While the origin of the trend dates back to ancient times, it is still a part of every Indian woman's wardrobe.\nBut, even in your wildest dreams, have you ever thought that wearing a Saree and Petticoat may lead to skin cancer? Yes, you heard that right. A research has shown that wearing tight petticoats teamed with sarees draped around the waist can put a lot of pressure on the abdomen, causing skin cancer.\nWhile wearing a Saree, many women tighten their petticoats (or underskirts), which can cause rashes, itching or other skin issues, ultimately generating the risk of cancer, doctors have observed.\nOver time, skin cancer may result from the tight petticoats increasing pressure on the waist and consistent rubbing on the skin.\nCauses of Saree and Petticoat cancer\nSome of the prominent causes of Saree and Petticoat cancer include continuous friction from the tight waist string, daily pressure on the abdomen from the pleats of Saree, sweat or moisture, absence of sunlight in such parts of the body.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of Saree and Petticoat cancer include - Darkening of the skin around the waist, red, itchy patches, formation of ulcers, and raised lumps around the waist.\nPreventive measures\nAs per a report by India Today, Dr Nataraj Naidu, Consultant Surgical Oncologist, SPARSH Hospital, Bangalore, suggest that women opt for looser, breathable fabric. They should ensure proper hygeine and follow regular skincare routines.\nMoreover, they should avoid wearing a saree on a regular basis and go for skin examination, in case, they develop unusual signs.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"], 'https://www.dnaindia.com/viral/report-3-indian-restaurants-featured-on-asia-s-50-best-list-2025-check-if-you-ve-eaten-there-3137567': ["3 Indian restaurants featured on Asia's 50 Best List 2025, check if you've eaten there", "VIRAL\nThree Indian restaurant ranked in Asia's 50 Best Restaurants 2025, showcasing India's culinary excellence.\nPravrajya Suruchi\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 06:16 AM IST\nThe recently released list of Asia's 50 Best Restaurants 2025 has brought pride to India, with three Indian fine-dining establishments securing spots in the prestigious ranking. Mumbai’s Masque, New Delhi’s Indian Accent, and Chennai’s Avartana have made it to the list, highlighting India’s growing influence in the global culinary scene.

The lab explores the aging properties of ingredients, their reactions to various flavors, and ways to bridge culinary cultures, leading to innovative dishes that surprise and delight guests.\nIndian Accent, New Delhi\r\n\tEstablished in 2009 by Rohit Khattar and led by Chef Manish Mehrotra, Indian Accent has received numerous global awards.

He has also been in favour of removing the country cap on H1-B visas and Green cards.\nTridivesh Singh Maini\nUpdated : Dec 26, 2024, 04:56 PM IST\nIncoming US President Donald Trump recently appointed Sriram Krishnan as his Senior Advisor on Artificial Intelligence. Chennai born techie Sriram Krishnan has vast experience and has been a general partner of the American venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz since 2021. He began his career with Microsoft, after which he joined Facebook. Till 2019, Sriram Krishnan worked for Twitter (now X) and closely worked with Elon Musk who will be co-heading DOGE (Department for Government efficiency)\nWhile announcing his appointment, Trump in a post on X said:\n“Sriram Krishnan will serve as Senior Policy Advisor for Artificial Intelligence at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy…Sriram will focus on ensuring continued American leadership in A.I., and help shape and coordinate A.I. policy across Government, including working with the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology”\nIn his post, Trump also mentioned Krishnan’s rich experience and the fact that he began his career with Microsoft.\nInterestingly, Sriram Krishnan has spoken in favour of expanding the H1B program and expediting the green card for individuals belonging to certain professions. He has also been in favour of removing the country cap on H1-B visas and Green cards.\nSeveral Trump supporters were critical of his appointment pointing to his stance on H1B and Green cards. Far-right American activist Laura Loomer said that Sriram Krishnan’s views on immigration are diametrically opposite to those of Trump and go against the “America First” agenda of Donald Trump. She also dubbed the Indian origin entrepreneur as a “career leftist”.\nDavid Sacks, Incoming White House A.I. & Crypto Czar\xa0 and Elon Musk came to Sriram Krishan’s defense.\nSacks highlighted the point that Sriram Krishnan does not want to remove all caps, but country-based ones. Said Sacks\n“Sriram still supports skills-based criteria for receiving a green card, not making the program unlimited. He wants to make the program entirely merit-based”..\nElon Musk also said that the criticism of Sriram Krishnan lacked merit and was based on the ‘fixed-pie’ fallacy. Said Musk in a post on X:\n“The ‘fixed pie’ fallacy is at the heart of much wrong-headed economic thinking. There is essentially infinite potential for job and company creation. Think of all the things that didn’t exist 20 or 30 years ago!”\nThe appointment of Sriram Krishnan points to the possible divide within the upcoming Trump administration regarding immigration policies.\nIt is not just Sriram Krishnan, even Elon Musk himself has repeatedly highlighted the fact that the US should be open to welcoming talented individuals who contribute towards the country’s economy.\nHere it would be pertinent to point out that Trump himself has spoken about the need for US to welcome and retain talent. During an interview, the incoming president had said that international students who graduate from US colleges should be granted Green cards. It remains to be seen if Trump actually implements this proposal.\nIn conclusion, it remains to be seen if Trump and his team go ahead with some of the tough policy reforms pertaining to immigration while also focusing on retaining international students with skills and qualifications. There could be divisions in the upcoming administration on the issue of immigration. Certain members of his team would not be opposed to an immigration policy which is merit-based, while others may favour an approach which is driven more by political interests and aimed at appealing to certain constituencies. While course-corrections in the realm of immigration policies are taking place across the Anglosphere – UK, Canada and Australia – some changes under Trump 2.0 can not be ruled out. At the same time an excessively insular immigration policy which discourages students and professionals would be counter productive for the US.\n(Disclaimer: The views expressed above are the author's own and do not reflect those of DNA.)\n\r\n\tThe author is a policy analyst and faculty member at the Jindal School of International Affairs, OP Jindal Global University, Sonipat.\n\n\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"], 'https://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/photo-gallery-katrina-kaif-and-vicky-kaushal-stuns-at-wedding-reception-serves-major-barbie-and-ken-vibes-3137623': ['Katrina Kaif and Vicky Kaushal stuns at wedding reception, serves major Barbie and Ken vibes', "LIFESTYLE\nMuskan Verma | Mar 09, 2025, 11:36 AM IST\n1.Barbie-inspired look\nKatrina looked breathtaking in a flared, off-shoulder pink gown adorned with a large floral detail, embracing her inner Barbie with grace.\n\n2.Vicky Kaushal’s dapper look\nVicky complemented Katrina’s glam look with a sharp black three-piece suit, exuding classic charm and elegance.\n\n3.Perfect chemistry\nFans couldn’t get enough of Vicky holding Katrina’s hand as they walked together, shows their love for each other.\n\n4.Heartwarming moment\nVicky melted hearts when he hugged Katrina’s sister, Isabelle Kaif, before leaving the event.\n\n5.Made for each other\nFrom their coordinated outfits to their undeniable chemistry, Katrina and Vicky once again proved why they’re Bollywood’s most adored power couple.\n\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"], 'https://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/report-nita-ambani-gifted-most-expensive-necklace-with-91-diamonds-to-her-badi-bahu-shloka-mehta-worth-rs-3137629': ["Nita Ambani gifted most expensive necklace with 91 diamonds to her 'Badi Bahu' Shloka Mehta worth Rs...", "LIFESTYLE\nNita Ambani gave her then-new daughter-in-law a super expensive gift, which was a necklace with 91 diamonds from Mouawad L'Incomparable.\nSonali Sharma\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 11:37 AM IST\nPower couple Shloka Mehta and Akash Ambani are celebrating their 6th wedding anniversary today, 9th March.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), cancer was responsible for nearly 10 million deaths in 2020, making it one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. The disease can affect any part of the body and often progresses silently, making early detection and prevention crucial. While genetic factors play a role, lifestyle choices significantly impact cancer risk. As we observe World Cancer Day 2025, it is essential to raise awareness about the steps individuals can take to reduce their risk and lead healthier lives. Here are five steps to improve overall health and lower the likelihood of cancer.\n1. Maintain a Healthy Diet\nEating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can strengthen the immune system and reduce inflammation. Avoiding processed foods, excessive sugar, and red meat can also lower cancer risk.\n2. Stay Physically Active\nRegular exercise helps maintain a healthy weight, regulate hormones, and boost immunity. Engaging in at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity, such as walking, cycling, or yoga, can significantly reduce the risk of various cancers.\n3. Avoid Tobacco and Limit Alcohol\nSmoking is one of the leading causes of cancer, particularly lung, throat, and mouth cancers. Quitting tobacco and reducing alcohol consumption can drastically lower the chances of developing several types of cancer.\n4. Protect Yourself from the Sun\nSkin cancer is one of the most common types, but it is highly preventable. Using sunscreen, wearing protective clothing, and avoiding excessive sun exposure, especially during peak hours, can help reduce the risk of skin cancer.\n5. Schedule Regular Screenings and Check-ups\nEarly detection can make a significant difference in cancer treatment. Regular health check-ups and screenings, such as mammograms, pap smears, and colonoscopies, can help identify potential risks and ensure timely medical intervention.\nAlso read:\xa0World Cancer Day 2025: Signs and symptoms of early-stage cervical cancer\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this article is for general informational purposes only.

To pass this competitive exam, a person studies religiously for several hours. Every year, thousands of candidates seek to take the exam to become IAS, IFS, IRS, and IPS. Only a few number of them succeed in the most competitive exam, which consists of three parts: preliminary exam, main exam, and interview. IAS Anudeep Durishetty, IAS Tina Dabi, and IAS Smita Sabharwal are some of the civil servants who have gained popularity among the netizens. Today we will talk about IAS Anudeep Durishetty whose remarkable journey serves as a testament to her unwavering dedication and resilience.\nAnudeep began preparing for the UPSC CSE after graduating from BITS Pilani and obtaining experience working as a software engineer at Google. Despite lucrative employment, he felt a tremendous desire to serve his country, which motivated him to quit his position and accept the demanding work of a federal servant. His first attempt in 2012 did not work out, and although his second attempt in 2013 got him a job in the Indian Revenue Service (IRS), his dream of becoming an IAS official was not realised.\nAnudeep continued in trying to pass the UPSC CSE in 2014 and 2015 in spite of the challenges. Despite his shortcomings, these defeats bolstered his determination instead of dampening his passion. Without the assistance of a coach, Anudeep accomplished an incredible accomplishment on his fifth attempt in 2017 by winning the UPSC CSE 2017 with an AIR 01 score in addition to making it into the prestigious IAS. He is the District Collector of Hyderabad at the moment.\nWhen Anudeep Durishetty secured AIR 1 in UPSC CSE 2017, he created history. He received a score of 1,126 out of 2025. He set a record for the highest UPSC exam score ever.\n\nAnudeep attributes much of his success to his family's encouragement. Their material and emotional assistance was crucial in enabling him to focus on his studies and accomplish his objectives. His narrative encourages others by emphasising the value of perseverance, familial support, and an unwavering commitment to one's objectives in the pursuit of excellence in public service.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"], 'https://www.dnaindia.com/hindi/india/news-why-did-baba-ramdev-get-angry-at-us-president-donald-trump-calling-tariffs-terror-he-said-he-is-neither-following-wto-nor-un-4153283': ['अमेरिकी राष्ट्रपति डोनाल्ड ट्रंप पर क्यों भड़के बाबा रामदेव, टैरिफ को टेरर बता बोले-वो तो ना WTO की मान रहे ना UN की', "भारत\nयोग गुरु और पतंजलि के सह-संस्थापक बाबा रामदेव ने अमेरिकी राष्ट्रपति डोनाल्ड ट्रंप पर रविवार को निशाना साधा. टैरिफ विवाद के बीच उन्होंने कहा कि यह 'टैरिफ आतंकवाद' है.\nमीना प्रजापति\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 06:18 PM IST\nBaba Ramdev on Donald Trump: योग गुरु और पतंजलि के सह-संस्थापक बाबा रामदेव ने अमेरिकी राष्ट्रपति डोनाल्ड ट्रंप पर रविवार को निशाना साधा. टैरिफ विवाद के बीच उन्होंने कहा कि यह 'टैरिफ आतंकवाद' है. अमेरिकी राष्ट्रपति डोनाल्ड ट्रंप द्वारा अन्य देशों पर रेसिप्रोकल टैरिफ की घोषणा को लेकर रामदेव ने दावा किया कि ट्रंप गरीब और विकासशील राष्ट्रों को एक नए 'बौद्धिक उपनिवेशीकरण के युग' की शुरुआत करके परेशान कर रहे.\n'बौद्धिक उपनिवेशीकरण का नया युग'\r\nमहाराष्ट्र के नागपुर में समाचार एजेंसी एएनआई ने उनके हवाले से आगे उन्होंने कहा, यह बौद्धिक उपनिवेशीकरण का नया युग है. जबसे डोनाल्ड ट्रंप सत्ता में आए हैं, तब से उन्होंने 'टैरिफ आतंकवाद' की एक नयी दुनिया बनाई है. उन्होंने गरीबों और विकासशील देशों को धमकी देर लोकतंत्र को ठगा है. यह आर्थिक आतंकवाद है... वह दुनिया को एक अलग युग में ले जा रहे हैं... इस परिस्थिति में भारत को विकास की जरूरत है...सभी भारतीयों को मजबूत राष्ट्र बनाने के लिए एकजुट होना चाहिए और इन सभी विनाशकारी शक्तियों को जवाब देना चाहिए.'\nUN-WHO की भी नहीं मान रहे\r\nस्वामी रामदेव ने कहा कि डोनाल्ड ट्रंप न तो WHO की परवाह कर रहे हैं और न ही UNO के नियमों का पालन कर रहे हैं. वे वर्ल्ड बैंक और IMF को अपनी मर्जी से चला रहे हैं. उन्होंने अमेरिकी डॉलर का मूल्य इतना बढ़ा दिया है कि गरीब और विकासशील देशों की मुद्राओं का मूल्य गिरता जा रहा है. यह आर्थिक आतंकवाद और 'टैरिफ टेररिज्म' है, जो दुनिया को एक नए और चुनौतीपूर्ण दौर में धकेल रहा है.\n\nटैरिफ पर ट्रंप ने क्या बोला?\r\nबता दें, दो महीने से भी कम समय पहले पदभार ग्रहण करने के बाद से ट्रम्प ने अमेरिका के तीन सबसे बड़े व्यापारिक साझेदारों - मैक्सिको, कनाडा और चीन - से आने वाले सामानों पर भारी आयात कर लगा दिया है. हालांकि, बातचीत के बाद ट्रंप ने अमेरिकी वाहन निर्माताओं के लिए मैक्सिको और कनाडा से आने वाले सामानों पर नए टैरिफ लगाने पर एक महीने की छूट दे दी. उनकी योजना 2 अप्रैल से पारस्परिक टैरिफ लगाने की है. ट्रंप की टैरिफ घोषणाओं ने भारत सहित वैश्विक वित्तीय बाजारों में अनिश्चितता पैदा कर दी, जिससे अस्थिरता पैदा हो गई.\nयह भी पढ़ें -\xa0अमेरिका के कैलिफोर्निया में फिर हिंदू मंदिर पर हमला, दीवारों पर लिखे इंडिया विरोधी नारे, भारत का क्या रहा रुख, जानें?\n\nमंदिर पर भी भड़के\xa0\r\nरामदेव ने रविवार को कैलिफोर्निया में एक हिंदू मंदिर में तोड़फोड़ की निंदा की और कहा कि भारत को 'धार्मिक आतंकवाद' पर लगाम लगाने के लिए पहल करनी चाहिए. उन्होंने पीटीआई से कहा, 'पूरी दुनिया इस धार्मिक आतंकवाद से पीड़ित है. सभी देशों के प्रमुखों को इससे बाहर निकलने का रास्ता खोजने की जरूरत है और भारत को इसके लिए पहल करनी चाहिए.'\n\nअपनी राय और अपने इलाके की खबर देने के लिए हमारे गूगल, फेसबुक, x, इंस्टाग्राम, यूट्यूब और वॉट्सऐप कम्युनिटी से जुड़ें.\n'UP में माफिया भी करते थे...'

I become very childlike when I am with her. The one thing I am mindful about is to enjoy her childhood. I try to be present with Raha, which is something I don’t do with other moments in my life.

Of course, (that’s true) for any parents. But when I see it, because I’ve known Ranbir before and I know him now, I see the difference. I see the difference in the way he is with people, you know, as a father. He’s just so sort of full. It’s not like he was ever edgy. He always had a very calm demeanour, but there’s a fullness which I experienced first-hand and that I see on a daily basis, and it’s actually really sweet and special to watch their conversations. He’s very creative when it comes to entertaining her. She entertains him as well, like they both have a very special friendship, I would say.

Unfortunately, their worst fears were confirmed when Henry failed the test on March 9 at Dubai International Cricket Stadium. Despite bowling during warm-ups, he felt discomfort and was ultimately ruled out of the match. Henry, visibly upset, struggled to hold back his emotions as he made his way back to the dressing room.\nHead coach Gary Stead and the coaching staff rallied around Henry during this tough time. With Henry sidelined, New Zealand had to make a last-minute adjustment to their playing XI, bringing in the relatively inexperienced Nathan Smith.\nBREAKING: Matt Henry is OUT of the ICC Champions Trophy final with a shoulder injury\xa0\xa0pic.twitter.com/qmBvTmVsiD\nHenry had sustained a shoulder injury while taking a catch in the semifinal against South Africa, which also seemed to have impacted his back. Despite this setback, Henry had been the tournament's leading wicket-taker, claiming 10 wickets in four matches, including a memorable five-wicket haul against India in the group stage.\nIn Henry's absence, 26-year-old Nathan Smith rose to the occasion. With seven ODIs to his name, Smith has shown promise with his bowling, averaging 41.71. While he hasn't yet taken a four-wicket or five-wicket haul in the 50-over format, Smith has also proven to be a valuable contributor with the bat, having scored three List A half-centuries.\nSmith's performance in the Champions Trophy 2025 opener and the tri-series final showcased his potential, and his overall record of 65 wickets in 56 List A games at an average of 32.49 highlights his consistency and reliability on the field. Despite the pressure of stepping in for Henry, Smith's previous performances indicate that he is more than capable of meeting the challenge.\nAlso read| 'Virat was the one who...': Ambati Rayudu breaks silence on Robin Uthappa's 'if Kohli didn't like anyone, they were cut' accusation\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"], 'https://www.dnaindia.com/cricket/report-virat-was-the-one-who-ambati-rayudu-breaks-silence-on-robin-uthappa-s-if-kohli-didn-t-like-anyone-they-were-cut-accusation-3137733': ["'Virat was the one who...': Ambati Rayudu breaks silence on Robin Uthappa's 'if Kohli didn't like anyone, they were cut' accusation", 'CRICKET\nRayudu, a top-ranked Indian cricketer, was left off the 2019 World Cup squad in favor of Vijay Shankar. Despite injuries to Dhawan and Shankar during the tournament, Rayudu was still not selected.\nChankesh Rao\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 04:44 PM IST\nThe former Indian cricket player Ambati Rayudu has responded to Robin Uthappa\'s recent, widely shared remarks accusing Virat Kohli of being the reason Rayudu was left out of the 2019 ODI World Cup team.\xa0 Rayudu made it clear that Kohli was the one who helped him get back into the Indian squad and supported him before the ICC event in England.\nRayudu, who was ranked as India\'s fourth-best player in the lead-up to the 2019 World Cup, showed his value with crucial performances.\xa0 But in the end, he was left off of the World Cup squad because all-rounder Vijay Shankar was selected instead.\xa0 When Shikhar Dhawan and Shankar both had injuries during the competition, Rayudu was once more overlooked.\nIn a recent interview with Lallontop, Uthappa claimed that then-captain Kohli showed favoritism, implying that a player could be dropped if Kohli disapproved of them. Uthappa suggested that Rayudu fell victim to this alleged bias.\n"If he (Virat Kohli) didn\'t like anyone, he didn\'t feel someone was good, then they were cut. (Ambati) Rayudu is the prime example. You feel bad. Everybody has preferences, I agree, but you cannot close the door on a player after taking him to the cusp. He had World Cup clothes and a World Cup kit bag; everything was there at his home. A player would be thinking that he is going to the World Cup. But you shut the door on him. That wasn\'t fair according to me," Uthappa told Lallantop.\nIn a recent interview that garnered significant attention on social media, Rayudu acknowledged that Kohli, despite his strong preferences, supported him for the crucial No. 4 position leading up to the 2019 World Cup.\n"What Uthappa was trying to say is that Kohli has strong likes and dislikes. But in my case, Kohli was the one who backed me. He liked me. When I was there at his captaincy, we played many games for India. He was the one who brought me into the team. He understands the struggle because he as well is from a humble background and has played tremendous cricket. It is never easy to excel as a batter coming from Delhi. To be a world-beater, especially in white-ball cricket, it\'s not easy. So he has seen everything," he said.\n"His leadership sometimes was found wanting, which everyone knows. What Uthappa mentioned was that during his captaincy, he made mistakes. It\'s not about preferences, but it\'s about logic, which may be at that point in time was not the right thing to do. I won\'t say Kohli or Ravi Shastri or MSK (Prasad) did that, it was a collective decision. They thought something else would be better for their team. But I don\'t think it was personal," he added.\nAlso read| Meet Jasmin Walia, British singer rumoured to be dating cricketer Hardik Pandya, cheered for him in Dubai during Champions Trophy 2025\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa\' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says \'Big Fan\' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress\' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina'], 'https://www.ezmall.com/?utm_source=Dnaindia.com&utm_medium=Affiliate&utm_campaign=Dnaindia.com_Traffic': 'Error: Could not fetch page: HTTPSConnectionPool(host=\'www.ezmall.com\', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /?utm_source=Dnaindia.com&utm_medium=Affiliate&utm_campaign=Dnaindia.com_Traffic (Caused by NameResolutionError("<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000256BC83A900>: Failed to resolve \'www.ezmall.com\' ([Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed)"))', 'https://www.dnaindia.com/education/report-meet-man-21-year-old-labourer-who-used-to-lift-400-bricks-for-8-hours-a-day-later-cracked-neet-with-score-of-3137578': ['Meet man, 21-year-old labourer who used to lift 400 bricks for 8 hours a day, later cracked NEET with score of...', "EDUCATION\nMeet a 21-year-old labourer from West Bengal who scored 677 in NEET 2024, overcoming financial struggles, and inspiring millions with his resilience.\nPravrajya Suruchi\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 06:17 AM IST\nSarfaraz, a 21-year-old daily labourer from West Bengal, has become a symbol of determination and hope after achieving an impressive score of 677 out of 720 in the NEET 2024 exam. Despite earning just Rs 300 a day by lifting 400 bricks, Sarfaraz never lost sight of his dream to become a doctor. His incredible journey caught the attention of PhysicsWallah founder Alakh Pandey, whose viral video brought Sarfaraz's story to the national stage.\nFor the past two years, Sarfaraz followed a grueling routine. He worked from 6 AM to 2 PM in a labour job to support his family, then spent his evenings studying. Even though many doubted him, Sarfaraz remained focused on his goal. His mother played a crucial role in his success, often sacrificing her own sleep on cold nights to help him study in their small home, which was built under the PM Awas Yojana. She recalled, “Our house had no roof earlier, and I would stay awake to ensure he didn’t feel cold.”\nSarfaraz’s hard work and sacrifices paid off when he secured a seat at the prestigious Nil Ratan Sircar (NRS) Medical College in Kolkata. His path was not easy. After completing Class 10, Sarfaraz had dreams of joining the NDA (National Defence Academy), but financial struggles and a serious accident forced him to abandon that goal. During the pandemic, he received government assistance to buy a phone, which became a turning point in his journey. He started studying through free YouTube videos by Alakh Pandey and later enrolled in an affordable PhysicsWallah course.\nIn his first attempt at the NEET exam, Sarfaraz joined a dental college but was unable to continue due to the lack of hostel facilities. Undeterred, he tried again in 2024 and achieved success. Moved by Sarfaraz’s dedication, Alakh Pandey visited his home, gifted him a new phone, offered him a repayable loan of Rs 5 lakh, and even pledged to cover his college fees.\nSarfaraz’s story is a powerful reminder of the impact of hard work, resilience, and the transformative power of education. His inspiring journey is similar to that of Sunny Kumar, an 18-year-old samosa vendor from Noida, who also excelled in NEET 2024 with a score of 664 while running his stall for 4-5 hours daily. Both stories highlight how determination and access to education can change lives, even in the face of extreme adversity.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"], 'https://www.dnaindia.com/hindi/dna-explainer/analysis-struck-between-china-taiwan-is-dealing-with-major-difficulties-question-arises-how-donald-trump-and-america-going-to-deal-with-nation-4153249': ['दुनिया के सबसे विवादित बिंदुओं में शुमार है ताइवान, समस्या का हल कैसे निकालेंगे डोनाल्ड ट्रंप?', "डीएनए एक्सप्लेनर\nताइवान के विषय में माना यही जाता है कि यह दुनिया के सबसे महत्वपूर्ण विवादित बिंदुओं में से एक है.   ऐसे में सवाल ये भी है कि डोनाल्ड ट्रंप इससे कैसे निपटेंगे? वहीं ताइवान को लेकर कि चीनी राष्ट्रपति शी जिनपिंग ने कहा है कि, आगे 'कठिन परिस्थितियां' आ सकती हैं.\nबिलाल एम जाफ़री\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 04:24 PM IST\nचीन के विदेश मंत्री वांग यी ने अमेरिकी टैरिफ के खिलाफ आवाज उठाई है और उस पर 'अच्छाई का सामना बुराई से करने' का आरोप लगाया है.\xa0बीजिंग में एक सप्ताह तक चलने वाली नेशनल पीपुल्स कांग्रेस के हिस्से के रूप में एक दुर्लभ प्रेस कॉन्फ्रेंस के दौरान बोलते हुए, वांग ने वर्तमान जियो- पॉलिटिकल\xa0\xa0माहौल के तहत ऐसा बहुत कुछ बोल दिया, जिससे एक नई तरह गतिरोध को बल मिल गया है.\nउन्होंने ताइवान के स्व-शासित द्वीप की स्थिति को भी संबोधित किया और चीन की स्थिति को दोहराया कि यह 'चीन का अविभाज्य हिस्सा' है और इसे स्वतंत्र बनाने का कोई भी प्रयास 'विफल होने के लिए अभिशप्त' है.\nअभी भी यह स्पष्ट नहीं है कि अमेरिकी राष्ट्रपति डोनाल्ड ट्रंप ताइवान के मुद्दे से कैसे निपटेंगे. ट्रंप का रूस की ओर झुकाव और यूक्रेन से दूर होना संघर्ष की स्थिति में ताइवान के प्रति अमेरिका की प्रतिबद्धता पर सवाल खड़े करता है.\nचीन जोर देकर कहता है कि ताइवान के साथ 'पुनर्मिलन' अपरिहार्य है. और कहता है कि यदि आवश्यक हुआ तो यह बलपूर्वक होगा. ताइवान की सरकार यथास्थिति बनाए रखना चाहती है.\nआधिकारिक तौर पर, अमेरिका, चीन की स्थिति को स्वीकार करता है और हमले की स्थिति में खुद की रक्षा के लिए द्वीप को हथियार मुहैया कराता है.\nध्यान रहे कि यह सब ताइवान को दुनिया के सबसे महत्वपूर्ण भू-राजनीतिक फ्लैशपॉइंट में से एक बनाता है. ताइवान स्ट्रेट के दोनों ओर के लोग अनिश्चितता और तनाव के आदी हो चुके हैं.\nपिछले महीने ताइवान ने एक चीनी जहाज को जब्त कर लिया था, जिस पर द्वीप तक जाने वाली समुद्री केबल को काटने का आरोप था. इस तरह की घटनाएं इस बात को उजागर करती हैं कि यह क्षेत्र कितना गर्म हो सकता है.\nसवाल यह है कि अगर यह भड़कता है, तो अमेरिका कैसे प्रतिक्रिया देगा?\nइस सवाल के मद्देनजर अब तक मिले-जुले संदेश मिले हैं. अमेरिकी विदेश विभाग ने हाल ही में ताइवान के बारे में तथ्यों को\xa0अपनी वेबसाइट में\xa0संशोधित किया\xa0\xa0है और कई वाक्यांशों को हटा दिया है.\xa0इस पर चीन ने कड़ी फटकार लगाई है.\nआधिकारिक तौर पर, ताइवान के प्रति अमेरिकी नीति में कोई बदलाव नहीं आया है. हालांकि, व्हाइट हाउस में राष्ट्रपति ट्रंप के होने के कारण, इसकी कोई गारंटी नहीं है. ट्रंप ने कहा है कि ताइवान को अपनी सुरक्षा के लिए भुगतान करना चाहिए और उस पर अमेरिकी सेमीकंडक्टर उद्योग को चुराने का आरोप लगाया है.\nअमेरिकी राष्ट्रपति स्पष्ट रूप से चीन के नेता शी जिनपिंग की प्रशंसा करते हैं और उनकी प्रशंसा भी की है. कई ताइवानियों के लिए यह परेशान करने वाला समय है.\nध्यान रहे कि दुनिया भर में जियो- पॉलिटिकल\xa0दरारें बढ़ती जा रही हैं\xa0 और बेचैनी की भावना है. अमेरिका, चीन और रूस के बीच संबंध उतार-चढ़ाव की स्थिति में हैं क्योंकि तीनों देश वर्चस्व के लिए संघर्ष कर रहे हैं.\nरक्षा के साथ साथ ग्लोबल जियो-पॉलिटिक्स को समझने वाले कई एक्सपर्ट्स ऐसे हैं, जिन्होंने इन कयासों को बल देना शुरू कर दिया है कि आने वाला वक़्त मुश्किल है.\nदुनिया छोटे बड़े कई युद्धों की साक्षी बन सकती है. ये तमाम कयास सही होंगे या फिर गलत इसका फैसला तो वक़्त करेगा मगर जो वर्तमान है और जिस लिहाज की राजनीति चल रही है चाहे वो चीन हो या अमेरिका सबका उद्देश्य एक दूसरे के सामने खुद को सुपर पावर दर्शना है.\n'UP में माफिया भी करते थे...'

Soon after taking the oath as president, he said he was returning as the 47th president “confident and optimistic” and that “a thrilling new era of national success” had begun. “A tide of change is sweeping the country. Sunlight is pouring over the entire world, and America has the chance to seize this opportunity like never before.”\n‘The rest of the world will envy us’Trump vowed at his inaugural Address that he would end weaponization of the Justice Department and stated, “The scales of justice will be rebalanced. The vicious, violent and unfair weaponization of the Justice Department and government will end.”\n‘I assure every American that I will always put ‘America First’, said Trump. “There will be sweeping changes, starting with the vicious weaponization of the Justice Department. From this moment on, America’s decline globally is over’.\nKenny Holston of The New York Times via AP, Pool, quotes Trump as saying that his “proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier,” as he continues his inaugural address.\nHe said, “Like in 2017, we will again build the strongest military the world has ever seen. We will measure our success not only by the battles we win, but also by the wars that we end. And, perhaps, most importantly, the wars we never get into.”\nBut, making his first major announcement, the newly elected President of the United States (POTUS) declared a state of emergency on the southern border of Mexico, which received a standing ovation from all Republicans and a few swing-state Democrats, including Reps—never mind 1960s singer Joan Baez’s ‘Jailhouse Trilogy’…“Luna was a Mexican, the law called an alien,/ He came across the border with a baby and a wife…”. Trump, incidentally, announced that he would deport “millions and millions of criminal aliens”.\nTrump wants to deport millions of people who live illegally in the US. However, he had already warned Mexico and other countries—even Canada!—of high tariffs and other penalties if they did not stop illegal immigrants from crossing the border.\nWhat Are Big Executive Orders?\nTrump is poised to pass several executive orders and directives on Day One in his second term as president related to matters ranging from energy to immigration, including declaring a national emergency at the US-Mexico border—tackling such issues as immigration, energy, trade and social policies. Moreover, more than 200 additional directives are coming in the next few days. The orders are in tune with Trump’s main campaign promises, including starting mass deportations and putting a lid on border security.\n“I’m pleased to say that, as of yesterday, one day before I assumed office, the hostages in the Middle East are coming back home to their families,” Trump added to a standing ovation from those present. Israel’s security Cabinet has approved a US-backed ceasefire deal with Hamas, which includes the release of hostages. The deal was delayed due to disputes with Hamas, but now it is moving forward\nThe Hamas-Israel ceasefire deal was mediated by Qatar and the US on Wednesday. However, Netanyahu said there were last-minute snags. But, in a significant move towards ending the 15-month-long war in Gaza, Israel’s government, on Saturday, approved the ceasefire agreement with Hamas (effect on Sunday, January 19, including a series of hostage exchanges)\nGulf of Mexico Is Now ‘Gulf of America’\nTrump announced that he would rename the ‘Gulf of Mexico’ as the ‘Gulf of America’\nDefining National Energy Emergency\nOn the energy front, Trump plans to declare a national energy emergency with the will to promote ‘affordable and reliable American energy’. His campaign promise, ‘Drill, Baby, drill’, speaks a lot of this for hiking domestic energy production\nThe Issue of Energy Development in Alaska\nTrump will issue an EO making energy development in Alaska a top priority, emphasising the state’s strategic importance to national security and its potential to become a key hub for LNG exports\nAdditionally, reports suggest Trump may withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement once again and take aim at policies supporting electric vehicles\nThe Issue of Trade and Tariffs\nMore actions may be imposing tariffs on global battery materials, rolling back environmental regulations and revoking California’s stricter emissions standards. Trump has his trade agenda planned out—clear and direct—with his US agencies reviewing trade relationships with such countries as China, Canada and Mexico. The US has planned immediate new tariffs, but the review could lead to significant changes\nTrump has proposed tariffs of 10% on global imports—that is 60% on Chinese goods and 25% on Canadian and Mexican products—arguing these measures could spur US economic growth. Critics, however, warn that such moves may increase consumer costs\nViews On Transgengender Rights\nAs part of a series of executive orders, Trump plans to issue an order defining only two genders strictly as male and female, effectively ending policies that recognize transgender identities in federal government practices. Trump also intends to ban transgender individuals from serving in the military, being recognized in US schools and participating in women’s sports\nPardons That Trump Expects to Give\nTrump plans to ‘pardon’ people who have been charged, or even convicted, for being involved in the Capitol attack on January 6, 2021—a violent attack in which an unruly mob barged into the lawns of the Capitol to disrupt Congress’s validation of the 2020 poll results. Trump wowed the crowd with so-called ‘baseless’ remarks of poll fraud at a rally earlier that day. However, he denied any responsibility for the violence that ensued.\nBy focusing on these sweeping changes across key policy areas, Trump’s Administration aims to rapidly implement its agenda from Day One.\nAnd These Were Trump’s Last Words\nAnd Trump’s last words were that he wanted to send US astronauts to Mars. “(We) will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars and plant the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars”, he added.\n(The author of this article is an award-winning Science Writer and a Defence, Aerospace & Political Analyst based in Bengaluru.

India will need to chase down this target to win the match.\nChankesh Rao\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 06:29 PM IST\nIn the 2025 Champions Trophy final at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Sunday (March 9), New Zealand won the toss and opted to bat first, setting a target of 252 runs for India. This total is the third-highest first-innings score in the tournament's history, making India's chase a formidable challenge.\nHistorically, the highest successful chase in a Champions Trophy final occurred when New Zealand chased down 265 to beat India by four wickets in the 2000 ICC KnockOut edition. South Africa's chase of 246 against the West Indies in the inaugural 1998 edition follows closely behind. Since the tournament was rebranded in 2002, no team has successfully chased a total over 250 runs to win the title.\nAside from the 2017 edition, where Pakistan posted 338/4 in their first innings against India, no team has crossed the 300-run mark in a Champions Trophy final. The matches in this tournament have typically featured lower scores, often impacted by rain interruptions that hinder high-scoring opportunities.\nIndia did well to limit New Zealand to 251/7 on the slow, turning pitch in Dubai, largely due to an impressive showing from their spinners. Varun Chakaravarthy took the first wicket of opener Will Young in the eighth over, followed by Kuldeep Yadav, who quickly dismissed Rachin Ravindra and Kane Williamson.\nRavindra Jadeja and Chakaravarthy continued the pressure by taking out Tom Latham and Glenn Phillips in the middle overs, while Daryl Mitchell steadied the innings with a solid 63 off 101 balls.

The incredible story of a farmer from Nashik, Sangita Pingale, who lost her husband and child, rebuilt her life through farming.\nVaishali Shastri\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 11:51 AM IST\nSuccess story of Sangita Pingale: Women entrepreneurs and the success stories of women in India are rich with determination and resilience. From fashion, finance, to even farming women have shown excellence in every field. Among many inspiring stories of Indian businesswomen, is the story of a woman farmer. The incredible story of a farmer from Nashik, Maharashtra, Sangita Pingale, who lost her husband and child and inspite of the fact that farming is mainly dominated by men, she rebuilt her life through farming and proved that women in farming can be successful.\nSangita Pingale was born into a farming family in a small village called Shilapur in the Nashik district of Maharashtra. Even though she belonged to a farming family, Sangita had a passion for studying since childhood and went on to earn a bachelor's degree in chemistry in 2000. She had dreams of becoming a government official and even when her father completely supported her in her goals, her destiny had a different path planned for her.\nSoon after her college education, she was married to Anil Pingale in 2000. Anil Pingale was a progressive farmer from the village of Matore. To make a better life after marriage, she supported her husband as a homemaker worked hard for the family. A year after her marriage, in 2001, she gave birth to a daughter but lost her father, which was a huge blow to Sangita. In 2004, their son was born, but he was disabled and passed away five years later which was another big blow to her. Despite all these hardships, Sangita did not lose her courage.\nIn 2007, another tragic event occurred when her husband Anil died in a road accident. At that time, Sangita was nine months pregnant, and 15 days later, she gave birth to a son. The joy of the arrival of the new life seemed small in the face of her deep sorrow.\nSangita received 13 acres of land in 2016, after the family’s possessions were being divided. Despite having no experience in farming and facing society's taunts, she did not give up. After initial guidance from her father-in-law, Sangita began to learn the intricacies of farming. Three months later, her father-in-law also passed away, and Sangita took on the responsibility of farming alone.\nShe mortgaged property to buy a scooter and started commuting to the fields. After a successful tomato harvest, she decided to cultivate grapes. Gradually, her hard work paid off, and she began producing 800-1,000 tons of grapes annually, earning an income of 25-30 lakh rupees.\nToday, her daughter is pursuing higher education, and her son is studying in a private school. According to Sangita, “I have proven my critics wrong.” Her story is an inspiration for women who are fighting social constraints and personal challenges. Sangita Pingale's life is proof that with determination and hard work, the impossible can be made possible.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"], 'https://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle': ["MS Dhoni's IPL future confirmed?

However, there are thousands of aspirants, who achieve remarkable success in the exam and set benchmarks for everyone.\nOne such name is that of IFS officer Anisha Tomar, who cracked the exam on her third attempt, despite dealing with her own set of struggles and hardships. Let's get to know more about her journey.\nWho is Anisha Tomar?\nSince an early age, Anisha possessed a strong passion for learning, which laid the foundation for her future. Having pursued her engineering from Punjab University, she went on to prepare for UPSC CSE.\nIn 2016, Tomar kickstarted her UPSC preparations by organising study materials according to the syllabus. She prepared a study scheduled, following it on an everyday basis. On her first attempt, she missed the chance by a narrow margin.\nHowever, the setback did not dishearten her, rather made her more determined to achieve the goals. In 2018, she again started preparing for the UPSC exam. This time, she discovered that she was diagnosed with\xa0Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH)- a kind of brain disease.\nDespite the hurdle, she didn't think of giving up once. Alongside her medications and tests, she appeared for the UPSC exam for a third time in 2020, clinching an All India Rank (AIR) 94.\nAfter her remarkable success, Tomar chose to become an IFS officer.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"], 'https://www.dnaindia.com/bollywood/report-this-amitabh-bachchan-film-baghban-was-rejected-by-distributors-saw-no-footfall-in-first-four-days-one-superstar-salman-khan-cameo-saved-movie-became-blockbuster-earned-rs-45-crore-3137657': ["This Amitabh Bachchan film was rejected by distributors, saw no footfall in first four days, one superstar's cameo saved it, movie became blockbuster, earned Rs...", 'BOLLYWOOD\nHeadlined by Amitabh Bachchan and Hema Malini, Baghban was rejected by the distributors. The film did not have a good run in the theatres in the first four days, but later picked up. Salman Khan\'s cameo saved the film, which went on to become a blockbuster in 2003.\nAman Wadhwa\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 01:34 PM IST | Edited by : Aman Wadhwa\nDirected by Ravi Chopra, the 2003 film Baghban featured Amitabh Bachchan and Hema Malini in the leading roles. Salman Khan and Mahima Chaudhry were also seen making cameo appearances in the family drama. In a recent interview, the late filmmaker\'s wife Renu Chopra shared how the makers faced challenges while making and distributing the film.\nSpeaking to Pinkvilla, she said, "Despite the film being ready, no distributor wished to take up Baghban. They called it old-fashioned and this was a time when Amit ji was on a decline and had just made a comeback with Mohabbatein and KBC. They all said no one would touch it." She further shared how Salman Khan\'s cameo saved the film as she continued, "Then someone suggested bringing Salman Khan on board for a guest appearance - the only part left to shoot. Ravi knew Salman, but not as well as we do now. Ravi went to his house to meet him. Salman lives in a two-room apartment and is the simplest man. The three Khan brothers were in the gym and one by one, they came out wearing shorts, making Ravi ji feel overdressed."\n"Then Salman came out, heard his role and immediately agreed to do the film. He said, \'I love this boy (Alok Malhotra, the character he eventually played). My concept of my parents is exactly this. I worship them and I will do the role.\' He did not ask how much we would pay him and simply asked where he needed to come for the shoot", Renu added.\nShe then recalled the experience of shooting with Salman for Baghban in London. Renu stated that Salman just made the request of not starting the work before 11 am. "He promised he wouldn’t leave until everything was done. Every evening, he’d invite us for dinner, and you couldn’t tell him what to order. He’d take over and order the entire menu. On the last day, when we tried to clear the bill, we discovered Salman had already paid it", she said.\nRenu Chopra also stated how the film saw no major footfall in theatres in the first four days but gained momentum from its fifth day. She shared, "Baghban did not have a good run on its first four days (Friday-Monday) in theatres. Ravi wondered why he made that film. But its fate changed on Tuesday and the movie picked up."\nMade in Rs 10 crore, Baghban went on to become a blockbuster and earned Rs 45 crore gross worldwide. It became the fifth-highest grossing Bollywood film of 2023 behind Kal Ho Naa Ho, Koi Mil Gaya, The Hero: Love Story of a Spy, and Chalte Chalte. The Ravi Chopra directorial also starred Aman Verma, Samir Soni, Saahil Chadha, Nasir Khan, Suman Ranganathan, Divya Dutta, Arzoo Govitrikar, Paresh Rawal, Rimi Sen, Lillete Dubey, and Asrani in pivotal roles.\xa0The film has also gained a cult status over the years after its re-runs on television.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa\' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says \'Big Fan\' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress\' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina'], 'https://www.dnaindia.com/bollywood/report-vijay-varma-raises-eyebrows-as-he-ignores-questions-at-iifa-2025-amid-breakup-with-tamannaah-bhatia-3137552': ['Vijay Varma raises eyebrows as he ignores questions at IIFA 2025 amid breakup with Tamannaah Bhatia', "BOLLYWOOD\nAs Vijay Varma walked the carpet, the media contingent eagerly awaited his response to the breakup rumours around Tamannaah Bhatia, but he tactfully sidestepped their queries\nVarsha Agarwal\nUpdated : Mar 08, 2025, 08:36 PM IST\nTamannaah Bhatia and Vijay Varma's whirlwind romance has reportedly come to an end.

The heartwarming narrative revolves around a lost two-wheeler, which sets off a chain of events as the entire village rallies together to save the marriage of their beloved daughter.\nThe narrative of Dupahiya is woven with multiple subplots, including a poignant love story, and rural politics at the gram panchayat level, among others. Bhuvan Arora's character is a devoted lover who goes to great lengths to save his ladylove, played by Shivani Raghuvanshi, who yearns to explore the world beyond their village. Meanwhile, Gajraj Rao as a school-teacher aspiring to be principal, compassionate father prioritises his daughter's happiness over his son's, showcasing a refreshing and unconventional family dynamic.\nRenuka Shahane plays the role of an ambitious Sarpanch candidate, determined to maintain a spotless crime record in the village. She is also a supportive mother who encourages her daughter to overcome her insecurities about her dark complexion. Sparsh Srivastava portrays Bhoogol, an aspiring influencer. His character shares a strong bond with his friend, played by Samarth Mahor. The narrative is further crowded by the introduction of additional characters, including Yashpal Sharma as a quirky inspector and Brijendra Kala as a wannabe reporter, among others.\nDirector Sonam Nair, known for her work on shows like Masaba Masaba, Kaafir, and Gippi, ventures into rural comedy-drama with Dupahiya. She successfully captures the essence of village life, bringing to life the story crafted by writers Avinash Dwivedi and Chirag Garg. Despite the creative team's efforts, the plot feels somewhat caricatured, particularly when we are already served the nuanced and heartwarming storytelling of TVF's Panchayat. It feels like a disappointing descent into rural comedy clichés despite Sparsh Shrivastava's best efforts.\nSome attempts at humor fall flat, feeling forced and awkward, and instead of evoking laughter, they come across as mocking the innocent villagers. Even certain elements, such as the portrayal of a deep-skinned girl's desire for fairness and the inclusion of a launda naach performance, are handled superficially, failing to provide meaningful exploration of complex issues like self-esteem and skin color.\nSparsh Shrivastava's performance is the sole redeeming factor, bringing a spark to the screen whenever he appears. Notably, even the more experienced Bhuvan Arora fails to match Shrivastava's on-screen charm and magic. Despite their best efforts, Renuka Shahane and Gajraj Rao feel miscast in the genre, likely due to underdeveloped character arcs and the weight of expectations from their established reputations. Samarth Mahor delivers a delightful performance, bringing a refreshing innocence and humor to his character, providing a welcome respite in the drama series.\nIn summary, Dupahiya attempted to explore a familiar genre but ultimately fell short, coming across as a caricature of rural life. The show's portrayal of villagers as foolish and naive is particularly misjudged, as people in rural areas are innocent but not lacking in wisdom. In contrast, Panchayat presented a nuanced and respectful representation of rural life, imbuing its characters with depth and dignity. Dupahiya is a passable one-time watch, but it fails to elevate the standard in the rural comedy-drama genre.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"], 'https://www.dnaindia.com/viral/report-shark-tank-india-s-judge-namita-thapar-whose-net-worth-is-rs-600-crore-reveals-being-bullied-as-girl-with-moustache-now-she-runs-3137563': ["‘I was called the girl with moustache’: THIS Shark Tank India's judge whose net worth is Rs 600 crore opens up about being bullied as kid", 'VIRAL\nThis Shark Tank India\'s judge opens up about childhood bullying, being called "moustache girl," and overcoming body image struggles.\nPravrajya Suruchi\nUpdated : Mar 08, 2025, 09:34 PM IST\nNamita Thapar, Executive Director of Emcure Pharmaceuticals and a popular judge on Shark Tank India, recently shared her painful experiences of being bullied as a child. Speaking at the India Today Conclave, she revealed how harsh judgments about her appearance impacted her deeply, expressing hope that societal attitudes will improve for future generations.\nNamita recalled being teased at school for her weight, acne, and facial hair. A particularly hurtful memory involved a boy mocking her as "the girl with the moustache" in Marathi, which left a lasting mark on her self-esteem. "Those words stayed with me. It was tough growing up with constant criticism about my looks," she said.\nThis isn\'t the first time Namita has spoken about her struggles. In a podcast with author Chetan Bhagat, she shared that she battled emotional eating for 40 years. Food, especially sugary treats, became a source of comfort for her. "When I felt hurt, I turned to food. It became a coping mechanism," she admitted.\nNamita\'s challenges began in school, where bullying over her appearance made her feel unattractive and insecure. She described how being called names like moti (meaning "fat" in Hindi) and the remarks about her facial hair took a toll on her mental health. These experiences led to a difficult journey with body image and confidence.\nFrom Bullying to Business Success\nDespite her early struggles, Namita went on to achieve tremendous success. Born into a conservative Gujarati family, she now holds a net worth of around Rs 600 crores. She earns primarily through her role at Emcure Pharmaceuticals but also has multiple income streams. These include her own business ventures, earnings from her role on Shark Tank India, and returns from her investment portfolio.\nNamita\'s story is a powerful reminder of how childhood experiences can shape a person. However, her success also highlights the possibility of overcoming hardships and finding strength. She continues to inspire many by openly discussing her journey, showing that success is not just about business acumen but also about resilience and self-acceptance.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa\' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says \'Big Fan\' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress\' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina'], 'https://www.dnaindia.com/sports/report-mitchell-santner-reveals-new-zealand-s-plan-to-tackle-varun-chakravarthy-ahead-of-champions-trophy-final-says-it-is-going-to-be-3137585': ["Mitchell Santner reveals New Zealand's plan to tackle Varun Chakravarthy ahead of Champions Trophy final, says, 'it is\xa0going\xa0to\xa0be...'", 'SPORTS\nSantner acknowledged that several New Zealand batsmen have faced Varun in the Indian Premier League. However, he highlighted that they will be studying his bowling videos closely in preparation for the final.\nApurwa Amit\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 08:01 AM IST\nNew Zealand captain Mitchell Santner has expressed his concern over the threat posed by Indian spinner Varun Chakravarthy in the upcoming Champions Trophy final. Varun, who had a significant impact on the Kiwi batting lineup during their last group-stage encounter, is likely to feature in the final.\nSantner acknowledged that several New Zealand batsmen have faced Varun in the Indian Premier League. However, he highlighted that they will be studying his bowling videos closely in preparation for the final.\xa0 Santner specifically mentioned Varun\'s 115 km/h slider as a major threat and emphasized the importance of being alert to this delivery during the match.\n"A little bit of mystery, but it was the first time some of the guys have been facing him. I think they\'ll learn from the other day. If the pitch plays a similar way, it\'s going to be a challenge along with all three of their other spinners. I think the boys will be ready for tomorrow. We\'ll look at a little bit more footage," Santner said in the pre-match press conference on Saturday.\nHe further added, "I think we obviously know what his threats are now. That 115 km/h arm bowl, that got me. That was a bit of a threat. But we know he\'s going to be a challenge."\nVirat Kohli, a senior member of the Indian batting lineup, is another player that New Zealand will need to be wary of in the Champions Trophy final. Kohli has been in exceptional form throughout the tournament, delivering two high-quality innings while chasing targets.\nDuring the press conference,\xa0Santner briefly touched upon Kohli\'s recent performances, specifically mentioning his innings against Australia. He highlighted how the Australian team struggled to dismiss Kohli in that particular match.\n"I think Australia were probably on track to score a few more runs. But they kept trying to take wickets through the middle. And then India were able to squeeze them back to that kind of 260. And then I guess the master of a chase, Kohli, kind of helped that out. So, I think whatever you end up doing, it\'s trying to do it well for, obviously, a long period of time. And yeah, hopefully, if we win the toss, we\'ll see what happens. But yeah, I think we\'ve kind of got to be ready for it to be either very similar to our game or a little bit different. And that\'s finding out what works with both bat and ball for a long time," Santner said.\nThe Champions Trophy final will mark only the second time New Zealand and India have met in the tournament\'s final.

This facility helps in simplifying the process for subscribers who wish to move their accumulated funds between different pension accounts. D-Remit is primarily designed for those who switch jobs, change locations, or opt for a different pension fund manager.\nSimplifying Fund Transfers for Subscribers\nD-Remit enables subscribers to seamlessly transfer their accumulated NPS funds without any disruptions. This eliminates the need for the traditional, cumbersome process that once required manual paperwork and involved multiple steps. The feature is intended to ensure continuity in retirement savings, which is crucial for individuals who frequently change jobs or relocate across the country.\nBenefits of D-Remit\nHow D-Remit Works\nUnder D-Remit, subscribers can request a transfer of funds from one NPS account to another through their current NPS account holder or the new account manager. This system reduces the complications involved in manual transfer requests and offers a more streamlined process. Subscribers simply need to initiate the transfer from their online account, making the process far more accessible and convenient.\nRole in NPS Growth and Accessibility\nD-Remit is seen as an important step towards increasing the flexibility and reach of NPS, especially for those working in the private sector or frequently moving across different geographical locations. By simplifying the transfer process, it encourages individuals to invest in NPS with more confidence, knowing that their retirement savings will not be hindered due to job or location changes.\nIn recent years, the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA)\xa0has been working on several initiatives to make NPS more accessible, with D-Remit being one of the key steps in improving subscriber experience. The system is expected to make it easier for new and existing subscribers to stay enrolled in NPS, improving overall participation in the scheme.'], 'https://www.cnbctv18.com/business/holi-business-likely-to-surpass-rs-60000-crore-this-year-19570934.htm': ['Holi business likely to surpass ₹60,000 crore this year', ''], 'https://www.cnbctv18.com/tags/genz.htm': ['Genz NEWS', ''], 'https://www.cnbctv18.com/technology/': ['Top Technology News', 'Mar 9, 2025 2:40 PM IST\nMar 8, 2025 8:30 PM IST\nMar 8, 2025 11:24 AM IST\nMar 8, 2025 10:10 AM IST'], 'https://www.cnbctv18.com/webstories/india/premanand-maharaj-temporarily-halts-padyatra-in-vrindavan-here-why-21803.htm': 'Error: Could not find an article title', 'https://www.cnbctv18.com/market/stocks/eicher-motors-share-price/EM/': 'Error: Could not find an article body', 'https://www.cnbctv18.com/market/stocks/hcl-technologies-share-price/HCL02/': 'Error: Could not find an article body', 'https://www.cnbctv18.com/market/stocks/mahindra-and-mahindra-share-price/MM/': 'Error: Could not find an article body', 'https://www.cnbctv18.com/market/stocks/sbi-life-insurance-company-share-price/SLI03/': 'Error: Could not find an article body', 'https://www.cnbctv18.com/travel/': ['Top Travel News', 'Mar 7, 2025 7:04 PM IST\nMar 7, 2025 5:57 PM IST\nMar 7, 2025 5:11 PM IST\nMar 7, 2025 3:14 PM IST'], 'https://www.cnbctv18.com/auto/': ['Top Auto News', 'Mar 9, 2025 3:03 PM IST\nMar 7, 2025 6:29 PM IST\nMar 7, 2025 6:26 PM IST\nMar 7, 2025 5:27 PM IST'], 'https://www.forbesindia.com/': 'Error: Could not find an article body', 'https://www.cnbctv18.com/market/stocks/indusind-bank-share-price/IIB/': 'Error: Could not find an article body', 'https://www.cnbctv18.com/privacy/': ['CNBC TV18 Privacy Policy', ''], 'https://www.cnbctv18.com/market/stocks/wipro-share-price/W/': 'Error: Could not find an article body', 'https://www.cnbctv18.com/market/gensol-engineering-share-price-promoters-sell-stake-assuring-buying-from-market-unlock-equity-reinvest-business-19570689.htm': ['Gensol Engineering promoters sell stake days after assuring buying shares from market', ''], 'https://www.cnbctv18.com/politics/': ['Top Politics News', 'Mar 9, 2025 5:58 PM IST\nMar 9, 2025 5:06 PM IST\nMar 9, 2025 4:13 PM IST\nMar 9, 2025 2:39 PM IST'], 'https://www.cnbctv18.com/market/stocks/adani-enterprises-share-price/AE13/': 'Error: Could not find an article body', 'https://www.cnbctv18.com/calculators/term-insurance-calculator/': 'Error: Could not find an article body', 'https://www.cnbctv18.com/market/stocks/shriram-finance-share-price/STF/': 'Error: Could not find an article body', 'https://www.overdrive.in/': ['Top Stories', ''], 'https://www.cnbctv18.com/market/stocks/itc-share-price/ITC/': 'Error: Could not find an article body', 'https://www.cnbctv18.com/education/': ['Top Education News', 'Mar 8, 2025 1:16 PM IST\nMar 7, 2025 5:34 PM IST\nMar 7, 2025 2:31 PM IST\nMar 7, 2025 9:37 AM IST'], 'https://www.cnbctv18.com/linkedin-newsletters.htm': ['Newsletters', ''], 'https://www.cnbctv18.com/sports/the-vijay-hazare-trophy-twist-that-inspired-selectors-to-pick-varun-chakaravarthy-in-indias-champions-trophy-squad-19570920.htm': ['The Vijay Hazare Trophy twist that inspired selectors to pick Varun Chakaravarthy in Champions Trophy squad', ''], 'https://www.cnbctv18.com/market-live/nasdaq/': ['undefined Index', "Today's Low\n\nToday's High\n\n52 Week Low\n\n52 Week High\n\n30 Days\n50 Days\n150 Days\n200 Days\nTrack today’s stock market activity with latest news and quotes on NASDAQ Composite (IXIC).

Here’s The Full Story', 'Do you remember those episodes of KBC in the 2000s where SRK and Amitabh used to call people for the phone-a-friend lifeline? Some acted surprised, and some almost fainted, but many of them used to give them an earful thinking that those were scam or fraud calls. Well, they were not completely wrong in their place. Why would most of us, the common people get a call from our favourite celebrities? I wish poor Anne had done the same when she was contacted by scammers pretending to be Brad Pitt and his mother.\nThe shocking case has emerged involving 53-year-old French woman Anne, who was duped into believing she was dating Brad Pitt and was subjected to a high amount of extortion. Appearing on the show “Sept a huit” on a local news channel TF1,\xa0 she revealed that the scammers deceived her into handing them over a sum of nearly 850,000 euros, which is around ₹7.5 Cr.\nFirst, she got a message while she was on a ski trip from an account posing as the actor’s mother Jane Etta Pitt. The text read – “It’s a woman like you that my son needs”. Though Anne was skeptical at first, she began chatting before being contacted by a person posing as Brad himself, telling her, “My mother told me a lot about you”.\nThus started a series of poems and declarations of love from that fake account to Anne. While the scammers always avoided her calls, a few AI-generated videos led Anne to be convinced that she was indeed talking to the Hollywood star. “There are so few men who write such things. I liked the man I was talking to and he knew how to talk to women,” she said. Anne soon started believing that she had a real connection with Pitt.\nThe financial scam however began relatively small, when the scammers told her that they had sent her expensive gifts from luxury brands like Chanel and Hermès. They insisted she pay 9,000 euros in customs fees to receive them, which Anne paid and of course, received no gifts.\nThe matter worsened when the imposters got to know about her divorce and the huge settlement she had received from it. They convinced Anne to send more money claiming he had kidney cancer, for the treatment of which he required money. Well, one obviously will doubt that such a huge star would be in dire need of money. However, the scammers fabricated a story that all of Brad’s accounts were frozen due to divorce proceedings with actress Angelina Jolie. Blinded by love and the doctored photos, she sent most of her compensation amount of 775,000 euros.\nWhen did Anne know that she was being scammed? Well, she had constant doubts when she was reading reports of Pitt dating the Swiss businesswoman Inés de Ramón. However, the scammers sent her a fake television report denying those claims. Anne finally accepted the truth last summer when she read further articles about Pitt and De Ramón. She also filed a criminal lawsuit claiming to be the victim of a scam, prompting a police inquiry.\nHowever, this doesn’t end here, TF1 said she had since made three suicide attempts and has been admitted to hospital for severe depression. After her interview went live, she became the victim of severe cyberbullying.\nWell, we as humans mostly give an unknown caller the benefit of the doubt – is that person really in trouble? We get swayed away quite easily when someone talks to us sweetly, and gently. Listen to us, don’t. Do the due diligence. Trust us, it’s for the best.'], 'https://www.scoopwhoop.com/entertainment/the-lifestyle-of-chris-martin-cars-mansions/?ref=home_read': ['The Lifestyle Of Chris Martin: Luxurious Cars, Lavish Mansions And No Dinner', 'It was in 2016 that I heard the name ‘Coldplay’ for the first time when they were all set to perform in Mumbai.

Spanning 6.5 acres, it has a hexagonal structure and a wellness retreat, horse facility, and recording studio.\nAccording to\xa0The Standard, Chris had purchased a $5,475,000 (₹ 47 Cr) 60s ranch house in Point Dume.

In a podcast with Conan O’Brien, Chris revealed that he had stop having dinner after his lunch with one of his heroes Bruce Springsteen. Bruce seemed fitter than Chris despite being nearly twice of his age. After learning that Bruce only took one meal a day, Chris adapted the same formula as his next challenge.

Intellectually and psychologically, women are still, often, expected to retreat into corners and not express their authentic selves. Why am I saying this? Am I a pessimist? Am I a misandrist? Am I a bitter, single woman, who can’t help but look for a chance to portray women as victims?\nI think I am just a woman who’s tired of seeing women being taken as jokes. Let’s take for instance, this TikTok trend that has taken the world by a storm – the ‘Girl Dinner, Girl Math’ trend. Women from all over the world are sharing how they manage their finances and what they eat for dinner under these hashtags. But it’s not just this, the idea behind ‘Girl Dinner,’ is to discuss the things we women eat when we’re at ease, when we feel like we’re exempt from the judgement of society, of patriarchy, of certain men who may look at our food, give it a disapproving frown and call it ‘unhealthy.’\n‘Girl Dinners’ are about throwing together easy-to-make meals that may even be described as lazy work. And the truth is, that’s the point. We want to be able to do something for our enjoyment, for the nourishment of our taste-buds and bodies without hearing critical comments that most women have grown up hearing. Comments such as, ‘Wow, you’re such a bad cook.’ Or, ‘No wonder you’re single, you can’t even cook a proper meal to feed yourself, how will you ever be able to cook for your partner, or children?’\nThe truth is that women are exhausted by trying to be good at things, so that they can serve the people around them. We’d like to be able to make an easy meal without someone telling us we need to ‘Be better, do better.’\nAnd we also understand that this isn’t an excuse to neglect your health and opt for unhealthy food, this trend is not an invitation to glorify poor eating habits. Rather, it’s an invitation to make peace with the fact that sometimes it’s okay to do the bare minimum. Sometimes, you deserve to give yourself ease, sometimes you deserve to give yourself the permission to be laid back.\nNow, the same applies to the ‘Girl Math’ trend. It’s not leeway to manage personal finances terribly. It’s an invitation to give yourself the freedom to take ownership of your hard-earned money. ‘Girl Math’ is about us women handling our finances with a sense of autonomy that may not resonate with people who are conditioned to understand money through the lens of patriarchy.\nBut, if I were to simplify it, I’d best describe it as spending money in a way that has earned you time to save your finances, has earned you the opportunity to extract full use of a high-end product, or spending money in a way where your savings aren’t being impacted.\nSo, though these trends may seem like frivolous little habits that many women may navigate their life with, they’re actually strategic long-term thought processes, that we’re mostly conscious of. And whatever little content that you do see under these hashtags that seems bizarre, is most probably satire that us women have conjured up to joke about our less-than-perfect habits. Because, maybe, just maybe, we know how to not take ourselves so seriously!\nThe truth is that these trends have given hundreds of women the space to be imperfect. Maybe it’s just a silly little trend, but it’s also virtual breathing space for women.'], 'https://www.scoopwhoop.com/author/ira-shukla/?ref=home_read': ['Ira Shukla', ''], 'https://www.scoopwhoop.com/about/?ref=footer_links': ['CATEGORIES', ''], 'https://www.scoopwhoop.com/laugh/?ref=sticky_nav': ['CATEGORIES', ''], 'https://www.scoopwhoop.com/author/manpreetkaur/?ref=home_read': ['Manpreet Kaur', ''], 'https://www.scoopwhoop.com/entertainment/tweets-to-read-before-streaming-black-warrant-on-netflix/?ref=home_read': ['13 Tweets To Read Before Streaming ‘Black Warrant’ On Netflix', "After a not-so-great year for the Indian OTT space in 2024, the new year starts with a promising new show. Created by Vikramaditya Motwane and Satyanshu Singh, Black Warrant has dropped on Netflix and the internet can’t stop raving about it.\nThe show tells the stories from arguably the best-known prison in the country – Tihar jail. It is based on the book Black Warrant: Confessions of a Tihar Jailer, co-written by the former jailer of Tihar, Sunil Gupta. In its bold and harrowing revelations, Black Warrant presents the controversial procedural lapses and the corruption that existed in the legal and judicial system.\nIn telling the stories of real-life infamous criminals like Charles Sobhraj and Ranga-Billa, the show eerily reminded me of the show Mindhunter (of course, if it was set inside an Indian jail with all its travesty and corruption). Here’s a glimpse into what Twitter has to say about the show starring Zahan Kapoor as Sunil Gupta, Rahul Bhat, Paramvir Singh Cheema, Anurag Thakur among others.\nAfter the peak era of web shows 4-5 years ago, Black Warrant is easily one of the best I've seen in a long time. pic.twitter.com/f841dB2buX\nBlack Warrant On Netflix Is Highly Recommended. pic.twitter.com/xIoUSEXLfn\nBlack Warrant is @NetflixIndia ‘s best original series since Sacred Games season 1.

Internet Roasts School for Cringe-Worthy English Names of Indian Dishes', 'If you thought renaming samosa as “rissole” was the limit of absurdity, think again. A viral Reddit post has sparked a fiery debate over a school’s decision to give traditional Indian dishes awkward English names in preparation for a quiz.\nThe post titled, “Colonial slave mentality is crazy in English medium schools,” revealed how classics like golgappa became waterball, gulab jamun transformed into rose water berry, and poha was rebranded as beaten rice. Naturally, desis are not having it.\nHere’s a quick look at the hilarious—and infuriating—renaming spree that left the internet facepalming:\n• Golgappa → Waterball\n• Samosa → Rissole\n• Dosa → Crispy Rice Pancake\n• Gajar Halwa → Carrot Pudding\n• Jalebi → Funnel Cake\n• Pakoras → Fritters\n• Kaju Katli → Cashew Nut Fudge\nDesi netizens didn’t hold back their anger (and wit). One user said, “No one calls gulab jamun rose water berry, not even foreigners!” A user hilariously pointed out how even international foodies prefer mispronouncing desi names over such tragic translations. Another said, “Why erase the essence of our culture?”\nSomeone compared the lack of translations for ramen, pho, and pizza, questioning why Indians feel compelled to “westernize” their own heritage. This spicy comment suggested flipping the script by translating Western foods into literal Hindi names.\nMany saw this as a deeper cultural issue, with one user adding, “Britishers really did a number on us.”\nWhile renaming dishes for “clarity” might seem harmless, it raises questions about cultural erasure. The heart of the debate isn’t just about bad translations but about how this reflects deeper insecurities tied to colonial hangovers. If Italy can proudly call pizza pizza, why can’t we stick with pakoda?\nThe post, which has over 500 upvotes on Reddit, has left people asking why schools feel the need to dilute culture rather than celebrate it. As one user wisely put it, “Call it pakoda, and if someone doesn’t get it, teach them what it is. You don’t need to translate identity.”\nIn a world that celebrates culinary diversity, maybe it’s time we do the same for our golgappas.'], 'https://www.scoopwhoop.com/originals/men-guess-the-price-of-women-s-dresses/?ref=home_read': ['Men Guess The Price Of Women’s Dresses', ''], 'https://www.scoopwhoop.com/': ['7 Couple-Friendly Hotel Chains That Won’t Judge You For Being With Your Partner', ''], 'https://www.scoopwhoop.com/all_shows/?ref=nav_show': ['CATEGORIES', ''], 'https://www.scoopwhoop.com/laugh/?ref=nav_top': ['CATEGORIES', ''], 'https://www.scoopwhoop.com/play/?ref=sticky_nav': ['Raj Or Rahul: Can You Guess What Was SRK’s On-Screen Name In These Movies?', ''], 'https://www.scoopwhoop.com/entertainment/saif-ali-khan-attack-all-you-need-to-know/?ref=home_read': ['Saif Ali Khan Out Of Danger: Here’s Everything That Has Happened So Far', 'In a shocking turn of events, Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan was injured during a late-night burglary incident at his residence in Bandra. The attack occurred during the early hours of 16 January, when an intruder entered his home and confronted one of the domestic staff. Attempting to step in, Mr. Khan was stabbed multiple times, which includes injuries near his spine.\nThe actor was rushed to Lilavati Hospital, where an emergency surgery was performed to remove the knife fragments. Hospital officials have confirmed that Khan is now stable, moved out of the ICU and is recovering under medical care. The intruder fled the scene, however, and authorities are currently investigating the same. Here’s a complete update on the case.\nAt 2:30 am, Saif Ali Khan was resting with his wife Kareena Kapoor Khan, and two young sons Jeh and Taimur when he heard noise in Jeh’s bedroom. The 56-year-old nanny, Eliyamma Philip alias Lima was the sole witness to the attack and sustained injuries on her right wrist during the fight. She was brought to Bandra police station for further investigation. Describing the incident, she said, “When I tried to see who was there, I saw a person coming out of the bathroom and moving towards Jeh Baba’s (Jehangir’s) bed”. She rushed towards Jeh to rescue him, while the armed intruder threatened her not to make noise and give him 1 crore rupees. Saif heard the scuffle and entered the room and the attacker attacked him. When Saif sir came, the accused attacked him with the Hexa blade and then also attacked Geeta (Taimur’s nanny), who had also come and tried to intervene,” Philip said.\nAs per reports, the actor and his nanny Geeta temporarily subdued the attacker and locked him in the room before going to another floor. However, upon returning, they found the room to be empty.\nThe knife hit Mr. Khan’s back, just one millimeter away from his spine, and was rushed to the Lilavati Hospital by his son Ibrahim Ali Khan at 3:30 am. The hospital confirmed to The Indian Express that Saif Ali Khan had sustained six wounds in total. As per Indian Express, “Two are deep cuts, primarily on his back, with one located near the spine. A minor wound is present on his neck, while the remaining injuries are superficial. The neurosurgery has been completed, and doctors are now proceeding with plastic surgery”. The actor was operated by a team of doctors which included a neurosurgeon and a cosmetic surgeon. The doctors also revealed that if the knife had been a millimeter deep, it would have resulted in saline fluid leakage and put the actor’s life at immense risk.  Dr. Nitin Dange, the neurosurgeon leading the spinal surgery, said, “The knife, lodged in the thoracic spine, caused a major injury, including a leak in the spinal fluid. We successfully removed the foreign object and repaired the spinal damage to prevent further complications. It was a delicate operation, requiring coordinated efforts from our team,” he stated.\nDr. Niraj Uttamani, Chief Operating Officer of Lilavati Hospital, said, “Khan’s injuries, while severe, were expertly managed by our team.” The actor is currently moved out of the ICU to a special room and recovering steadily.  Out of danger now, he is likely to be discharged in two days.\nDCP Dixit Gedam has confirmed that an FIR has been officially registered against the accused carrying grave non-bailable charges like Section 311, 312, 331(7), and others. The police have deployed ten teams, alongside five specialized crime branch units to investigate Bandra and nearby hotspots. Forensic teams have collected the evidence from Saif’s home and building to track down the attacker. Along with that, the police have also released CCTV images capturing the intruder on the sixth floor of Saif’s house which was last spotted in Prabhadevi.\nThe intruder entered the building using a second entrance which wasn’t high and had a tear on its net, leading to a suspect that an insider facilitated the theft. He used the shaft as he was not spotted using the lifts or lobby. The police have currently detained a suspect at the Bandra police station this morning. However, no arrests have been made till the time of writing\nIn an Instagram post, Kareena Kapoor Khan requested privacy regarding the unfortunate events. Writing on her Instagram story, she shared, “It has been an incredibly challenging day for our family, and we are still trying to process the events that have unfolded. As we navigate this difficult time, I respectfully and humbly request that the media and paparazzi refrain from the relentless speculation and coverage”.\n“While we appreciate the concern and support, the constant scrutiny and attention are not only overwhelming but also pose a significant risk to our safety. I kindly request that you respect our boundaries and give us the space we need to heal and cope as a family. I would like to thank you in advance for your understanding and cooperation during this sensitive time.” she wrote.\nThe actor was paid a visit by many stars and friends including Ranbir Kapoor, Alia Bhatt, Malaika Arora, Karan Johar, Amrita Arora, and Arjun Kapoor. Many of them wished him a speedy recovery on social media. The incident also raised concerns about the safety among the elite neighbourhoods of Mumbai, especially after the constant threats to Salman Khan and killing of Baba Siddique.\n'], 'https://www.scoopwhoop.com/category/men/?ref=nav_links': ['Men', ''], 'https://www.scoopwhoop.com/entertainment/can-you-guess-the-bollywood-actor-from-just-two-lines/?ref=home_read': ['Quiz: Can You Guess The Bollywood Actor From Just Two Lines About Them?', '\n\n\nSo, what are you waiting for?

However, Indian Swifties haven’t been very lucky till now to experience their favorite global pop star and the most-streamed artist on the planet tour in India. Despite organizing 149+ shows in more than 50 cities, the Eras Tour left Indian Swifties disappointed as it didn’t include India as a venue in the international shows.\nRecently, Shanghai officials have revealed that they are in talks with Swift’s team about a possible performance in the city of Shanghai, as China was skipped by the singer during her Eras Tour. The Eras Tour was famous for its economic impact in cities across the United States, Europe, and Asia and was the first to earn over $1 billion in revenue, according to Reuters.  This brings us to one question – despite being so popular in India, why hasn’t Taylor Swift toured in India?\nThere are multiple reasons for this, but one of the major is the vinyls and records. Artists like Taylor Swift release their albums as vinyl and records, which is a popular streaming source in the West. Album sales are one of the major sources of revenue for artists and they measure their popularity by the sales number. Swift is known for dropping limited-edition albums, often breaking records “in the middle of the night”.  This gives her team insights into where her strongest fan base lies.\nHowever, in India, the streaming sources are dominated by platforms like Spotify and YouTube, reducing album sales, rather than investing in physical copies of albums. Also, they are expensive for the majority of the audiences Without these sales, it might be difficult to predict the turnout and ticket demand for her concerts as it might seem that Indian audiences are not willing to spend money on the artist.\nBut one can argue that Spotify streams can be a good metric to gauge her popularity in India because let’s be honest, not just Swifties, a lot of people listen to her. It is also important to know that despite being popular, Taylor Swift is not among the Top 10 most streamed artists in India on Spotify. So eventually her team had a statistically stronger reason for organizing a concert and bearing the logistical costs.\nWell, when Taylor Swift announced that she was going on a global tour in 2023, Indian swifties were hopeful of one, rare, enchanted glimpse of their favorite artists. However, the Asian leg of Taylor’s tour saw her only perform in Singapore and Japan. Industry insiders speculate that Singapore may have had an exclusive agreement with the pop star, allowing it to be the only city in the South Asian region. With some added incentive, Swift pursued to make Singapore her only stop during the tour, therefore leaving the rest of the potential cities out of the radar. Srettha Thavisin, the prime minister of Thailand, recently disclosed that he was informed by the concert producer Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG) that Taylor Swift would not be able to play anywhere in Southeast Asia while on tour.\nMr. Thavisin claims that AEG told him that the Singaporean government had negotiated an exclusive contract with Taylor Swift, providing the exclusive right to host the tour in Southeast Asia in exchange for a hefty $2 million to $3 million per event. This spurred bad blood among the neighbors alleging that it was a bad practice to snatch the economic benefits of Swift’s tour.\nWith this agreement, it wouldn’t be unfair to assume that India lost the one chance to host the pop star, feeling like they’re living in the “Blank Space”.\nHowever, there is no denying that Taylor’s tour is a Mastermind plan of action.  Her logistics are super-fast and it is reported that she has two stages – while she performs in one location, her crew is busy setting up another stage at another location for convenience. Organizing a concert of that scale isn’t a simple feat. The production, multi-stage setups, elaborate visuals, rigorous schedule, and crowd controlling require a venue that can match her requirements in terms of size, technology, and safety standards.\nWhile India does have large venues like DY Patil Stadium or Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, the logistical challenges were very visible during recent performances of Diljit Dosanjh, Bryan Adams, Karan Aujla, and other artists. This shows that India is still “delicate” with a growing concert scene as compared to established hubs like Singapore, Tokyo, or other Western countries.\nOh and how can you forget the price sensitivity of our audiences and the ticket prices? According to the Economic Times, Swift was the most sought-after performer in 2023, with an average ticket price of $1,088 or a whooping Rs. 87,186.  The initial face value of tickets is priced from $49 to $499 or Rs. 4,238 to Rs. 43,160, which are also considered expensive. Given the fiasco after Diljit’s or Coldplay’s ticket sales, the number can be expected to go much higher.  This\nThe internet has mixed reactions to whether Swift will perform in India.  While some have expressed how popular she is in India, some have shown a bit of reluctance on the capacity of India to hold her concert. Some of them also shared their experiences of visiting other shows in the Eras Tour. Take a look:\nDespite these challenges, it looks like we have a silver lining. Despite these challenges, the Indian music scene is evolving rapidly, with global artists like Ed Sheeran, Coldplay, and Maroon 5 already making their mark in the country. The demand for Taylor Swift’s music is undeniable, with millions of Indian fans streaming her songs and trending hashtags to bring her to India.\nAs the concert industry in India matures, infrastructure improves, and fan engagement diversifies, the chances of seeing Taylor Swift perform in India grow stronger. For now, Indian fans can only hope that Taylor’s long-overdue India debut happens soon, as her fan base here is “Ready For It”!'], 'https://www.scoopwhoop.com/category/entertainment/?ref=home_masthead': ['Entertainment', ''], 'https://www.scoopwhoop.com/?ref=sticky_nav': ['7 Couple-Friendly Hotel Chains That Won’t Judge You For Being With Your Partner', ''], 'https://www.scoopwhoop.com/fashion/blenders-pride-fashion-tour/?ref=home_read': ['Blender’s Pride Fashion Tour Celebrates Fashion Icon Rohit Bal’s Legacy in Gurugram', 'Rohit Bal, fondly called Guddu by his close ones, truly\xa0 changed the course of Indian fashion.

Sharing his ideas, he said, “We’re going to have glasses, and we’re going to be able to be here, and I’m going to be able to, you know, text my wife or friends or something. Or text AI and get an answer to something. Like, if I forgot something while we were talking, I could just text AI – okay, I just did that. You’re just sitting there, totally discreet, with glasses, and the answer just comes to you”.\nTalking to Joe, he explained how smartphones limit interactions, saying, “We have our phones, but, you know, it’s like they take you away from the physical environment around you. You’re kind of sucked into this little screen. I think in the future, as our computing platforms evolve into more of a glasses or even contact lens form factor, the internet will get overlaid onto the physical world. It won’t be like we have the physical world and then all our digital stuff through this tiny little window. Instead, all your attention will stay on the world, where the physical and virtual elements are seamlessly overlaid together.”\nIt isn’t the first time Meta CEO has admired the technology behind smart glasses and predicted the end of smartphones. Zuckerberg has reportedly predicted that within the next decade, smartphones will be taken over by smart glasses in terms of popularity and practicality. In a past podcast with Cleo Abram, Mark Zuckerberg stated that AR glasses can be the next major platform after phones.\nHonestly, this might seem a little far-fetched but so was the idea of smartphones and video-calling to our parents back in the 90s. Neither of them thought that we could talk to our loved ones no matter where they were sitting. Technology is upgrading itself each day and the new future is here in the form of glasses. I remember seeing Tony Stark and Devi Lal Singh (Kick) using their hands in the air to build their ideas, I believe it wouldn’t be very far that I can see people in the streets doing the same, wearing AR Glasses. And let’s not forget, VR Headsets are already here.\nWhile some of us may not be the early adopters of technology, chances are we will soon see it around us and in the next few decades even use it actively. It will make technology more accessible, seamless, and well-integrated into our daily lives – just by wearing it. There will be hands-free interaction, real-time information, and immersive gaming and entertainment experiences.\nHonestly, to me, it sounds a little scary to let go of my smartphone and get a pair of glasses to do the same. It will also mean that these glasses will have even more access to my daily life and activities, thus increasing the risk of privacy and intrusion. It will reduce face-to-face interactions and instead increase isolation, cognitive overload, social awkwardness and detachment, something that we are already struggling to solve with smartphones. Along with that, it also hints towards addiction, 24/7 connectivity to the internet, and the digital divide due to its initial costs.\nWell, looks like the future won’t remain in our pockets anymore.'], 'https://www.scoopwhoop.com/show/cook-off/?ref=home_read': ['Cook-Off', ''], 'https://www.scoopwhoop.com/category/weddings/?ref=home_read': ['Weddings', ''], 'https://www.scoopwhoop.com/category/bigg-boss/?ref=nav_links': ['Bigg Boss', ''], 'https://www.scoopwhoop.com/category/opinion/?ref=nav_links': ['Opinion', ''], 'https://www.scoopwhoop.com/entertainment/the-news-is-out-diljit-dosanjh-is-officially-the-global-brand-ambassador-for-levis-were-losing-our-minds/?ref=home_read': ['The News Is Out!

Riding my brand-new Royal Enfield Himalayan 450, I embarked on a 14-day expedition with 25 complete strangers, all from different walks of life. It felt like a real-life Roadies experience, minus the drama and the vote-outs!\nAs I navigated the breathtaking trails of the Northeast, my bike proved to be the perfect companion. The powerful pick-up and smooth handling made even the toughest off-road terrains feel like a knife slicing through butter. This magical adventure kicked off in Guwahati, Assam, known as the Gateway to the Northeast. Little did I know, the journey ahead would be one of the most exhilarating rides of my life.\nRiding into Cherrapunji from Guwahati on my bike, a wave of nostalgia hit me. Suddenly, all those geography lessons from school came rushing back, about Cherrapunji being the wettest place on Earth (now the second). And true to its reputation, Meghalaya lived up to its name, which means “the abode of clouds”.\nThe weather was as unpredictable as the journey itself. One moment, I was drenched in sweat from the humid heat, and the next, the clouds soaked us completely with rain. But that’s the magic of Meghalaya – you don’t just see the beauty, you feel it. After getting lost in the magic of Meghalaya we headed back to Shillong to enjoy local delicacies like a traditional rice dish called jadoh, barbeque pork, etc. And then, we explored the bustling Police Bazaar for shopping.\nThe next day’s ride was smooth and effortless, thanks to my trusty Himalayan 450. Our destination? The Living Root Bridge – a bridge not built by humans but grown by nature itself. The roots of ancient trees have intertwined over time, forming a sturdy connection across the river. Walking across it felt surreal, as if stepping onto a masterpiece crafted by nature’s own hands.\nIt was time to head back to Assam and explore its wildlife wonders. Leaving the mountains behind, we hit the open plains, and riding at 150 km/h on a straight highway, I had a realisation, if the bike was the beast, then I was the beauty, and this beast had my back. Reaching Kaziranga National Park, we set out on a safari, and to my shock, the first animal I spotted was a freaking tiger! Watching it move gracefully from a safe distance was a dream come true for a cat lover like me. As we explored further, we encountered the majestic one-horned rhino, deer, monitor lizards, wild buffalo, and more.\nOur next stop was Majuli, a unique island in the middle of the Brahmaputra River. Getting there was an adventure in itself, we rode to the ferry point, carefully loaded our bikes onto the ferry, and set off towards the island. Once we arrived, we were welcomed with the vibrant Bihu dance and got a taste of their local rice beer, Apong. And let me tell you – it was one hell of an experience!\nThis was something I had been most excited about,- heading to Ziro in Arunachal Pradesh. It was my first time there, and every second was worth it! The lush greenery, the cool temperature, the warm people, and even the surprisingly cheap alcohol (cheaper than Goa!) made it an unforgettable experience. We visited the Apatani Tribe’s homes and their paddy fields, where elderly Apatani women sang and danced in their local language called Tani. I had always wanted to visit Ziro for its famous music festival, but this was something else: peaceful, grounding, and deeply soulful.\nOn Day 7, we took a pit stop at Nameri National Park before heading to Dirang, as it was a long journey. But what awaited us on Day 8 was truly something special.\nThis ride to Dirang was where we witnessed the real beauty of Arunachal Pradesh, spotting Mithuns (large domestic cattle) and yaks casually roaming around, animals you don’t get to see in everyday life. The most surreal part? Riding through the clouds, feeling the cool moisture and the gentle rain they carried.\nThis was by far one of the most adventurous rides of the entire trip. After crossing the Sela Tunnel, we witnessed a frozen waterfall, a sight straight out of a dream. But while I once thought my boss was my biggest enemy, I quickly realized the real one was black ice, making the ride dangerously slippery. Thankfully, my bike made it easier as its suspension and tire grip gave me the confidence to push through safely. Reaching Tawang was a spiritual experience, and I felt incredibly lucky to be there during the festival season.\nAfter Tawang, we wrapped up our journey, heading back to Guwahati. And let me tell you, throughout this entire trip, it was my bike that gave me the confidence to ride through it all. Now, I truly understand why people fall in love with their bikes.\n\n⭐Awesome'], 'https://www.scoopwhoop.com/terms-and-conditions/?ref=nav_links': ['Terms of Use', ''], 'https://www.scoopwhoop.com/category/fashion/?ref=home_read': ['Fashion', ''], 'https://www.scoopwhoop.com/category/tech/?ref=home_read': ['Tech', ''], 'https://www.scoopwhoop.com/read/?ref=home_read': ['14 ‘Woke Feminists’ Reveal Why ‘Animal’ Is The\xa0Best Film\xa0Indian Cinema Has Given Us\xa0In A Long Time', ''], 'https://www.scoopwhoop.com/in-other-news/people-working-in-ambani-antilia-share-experiences/?ref=read_hot?ref=read_masthead': ['10 People Who Have Worked For The Ambani Family Reveal What’s It Like Being Employed By Them', 'The lives of the rich are often hidden from plebians like us.

But to his dismay, he encountered what he described as “bad behaviour” from Indian tourists there as well.\nI went to Vietnam for the new year break, and Goa was a choice. But not for the reasons any of you people on twitter go bonkers about. Goa has too many North Indian tourists and they ruin the experience. Even in Vietnam, the only bad behavior was from North Indian tourists.… https://t.co/CHiZeVRgoT\nFrom cutting lines with excuses like “Hum logon ke pass special pass hai” to shouting Bharat Mata Ki Jai in a crowded train, Handa claimed the loud antics were mostly from North Indians. “I even stopped one at the cable car line,” he added, “but arguing seemed pointless.”\nNaturally, Twitter took sides faster than a tea-seller at an Indo-Pak match. Many users lashed out at Handa for stereotyping North Indians, calling his remarks “racist.”\n“How did you know they were North Indians?” asked one user, to which Handa replied that the tourists explicitly mentioned being from NCR. Another user pointed out, “This mentality of dividing North, South, East, and West is why we can’t progress as a society.”\nUber racist comment 🤮How did you know that misbehaving tourists were North India?You can tell everything about a person by looking at him 🤭\nWhile Handa’s comments did raise eyebrows, they also found some support. Many North Indians chimed in, admitting they’ve witnessed similar behaviour. “Me, being a North Indian myself, always felt ashamed, but now it’s a whole new level of shame!” wrote one user.\nYep. We have to agree that we Indians don't have civics sense (including me). We need to improve. And more people coming out on SM is one such way to nudge us to improve.\nAnother added, “There was a group of North Indians on a train in Europe, making too much noise in the name of ‘having a good time.’ All the other Europeans were silent, and only these people were shouting.”\nThe debate has reignited conversations about travel etiquette and the stereotypes associated with Indian tourists abroad.

However, the one aspect of the news that no human can ignore is ‘jobs’. It doesn’t matter if you even have your own business, everyone is affected by the job market. On the 7th of January, the World Economic Forum published its report titled ‘Future of Jobs Report: 2025”. The findings of the report are derived from surveying more than 1000 companies in the world representing 22 industry clusters.\nThe report contains the list of the fastest-growing and declining sectors of jobs in the world by the year 2030. It also predicts the job trends and their impact on various industries of the global market in the coming years. The demographic shifts and geopolitical conflicts play a huge role in this. You must have seen numerous posts on social media about which industries will dominate in the coming years. Somewhere you must be seeing farming at the top and somewhere there must be the mention of Artificial Intelligence at the top. Here’s us simplifying what the report has to say.\nThe report predicts about 170 million new jobs will be created by 2030. However, approximately 92 million will be displaced during this time. This results in 78 million net new jobs formed in the world.\nIn terms of absolute numbers, the below 5 jobs will see the highest growth in demand.\nThe rapid rise in the number in the farming industry is due to the green initiatives taken by many countries for a more sustainable future. These would be followed by food processing and related trades workers; car, van, and motorcycle drivers; nursing professionals; food and beverage service workers; general and operations managers; social work and counseling professionals; project managers, university and higher education teachers; secondary education teachers; and personal care aides.\nIn terms of percentages, the following job roles are said to grow at the fastest rate in the coming decade. Owing to the AI and big data revolution, it’s no wonder that there is a rapidly growing demand to secure high paychecks.\n1. Big data specialists\n2. FinTech engineers\n3. Al and machine learning specialists\n4. Software and applications developers\n5. Security management specialists\nOn the other hand, many traditional desk jobs have made it to the list of the fastest-declining jobs.\n1. Postal service clerks\n2. Bank tellers and related clerks\n3. Data entry clerks\n4. Cashiers and ticket clerks\n5. Administrative assistants and executive secretaries\nAnother job that suffers from this declining trend is that of graphic designer. With AI elevating its magic to newer heights each day, these creative professionals’ job security is under serious threat.\nThe report also tells that the skills gap continues to be the most significant barrier to business transformation today. Nearly 40 percent of skills required on the job are set to change, and 63 percent of employers are already citing it as the key barrier they face.\nHowever, AI is not here to make our lives all gloomy. Relax, the zeroes and ones are not here to make you unemployed. In the list of the most required and desired skills, the most dominant ones are human skills.\nAnalytical thinking leads the charts, followed by resilience, flexibility, and agility are some of the core skills required in the coming years. This is followed by leadership and social influence, creative thinking, motivation and self-awareness, technological literacy, empathy and active listening, curiosity and lifelong learning, talent management, and service orientation and customer service.\nSo certainly upskilling ourselves in the coming years is the only way to be part of this global job market revolution. However, don’t panic. As the saying goes, AI won’t take your job, but a person who knows how to use it might.'], 'https://www.scoopwhoop.com/in-other-news/ios-android-price-difference-apps-zepto-uber/?ref=home_read': ['Netizens Share Price Differences On Delivery Apps For iOS & Android And We Are Shocked!', 'Delivery apps are a lifeline for many of us, especially those with the busiest schedules.

However, this world of convenience isn’t as perfect as it seems. As more and more users are now adopting this quick commerce lifestyle, they can’t help but notice some particular patterns – which are not ethical per se.\nWell, if you have ever compared notes with your friends and realized that your groceries or delivery bills on these apps don’t really match, you are not alone. Recently a lot of netizens have shared their experiences on social media platforms about dark patterns that these apps have adopted. But a particular one in highlight is the price difference for iOS and Android. Users have spotted slightly (and sometimes considerably high) prices of the same groceries when ordered from the same location at the same time. The only difference is their phone model.\nThis has resulted in a lot of questions, including – are apps charging us differently based on the device we use? Because it looks like they are. Recently, Vinita Singh from LinkedIn shared her experience when she discovered that capsicums were priced at a huge difference on Zepto for an Android and iOS phone.\nThe Android phone showed the difference to be Rs. 21, whereas the iPhone showed it to be almost Rs. 107. A whopping difference of Rs. 86. The users shared their experiences in the comment section. While one user commented “iPhone leke ghumte ho kharcha to hoga na”, one user justified the difference as: “(more)….. Apple is charging $965 more than Google to keep your app published. So, companies have to find a way to manage this cost, and I guess the users, for whom companies need to pay this amount, should be the best source to manage this extra cost.”\nThis isn’t just an isolated incident. Multiple users have complained about the dynamic pricing between iPhone and Android users. Take a look:\nHey @ZeptoNow , I understand that I’m using an iPhone, but that doesn’t mean I can afford to pay more than Android users for the same product.

Well, that’s just a regular day in the life of Jagdeep Singh, the founder and former CEO of Quantumscape.\nWith an annual salary of ₹17,500 crore, Singh holds the title of the highest-paid employee in the world. But beyond the jaw-dropping numbers, his story is one of relentless ambition, innovation, and the unstoppable rise of the EV industry.\nJagdeep Singh’s journey is anything but ordinary. Armed with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from the University of Maryland, a Master’s from Stanford University, and an MBA from UC Berkeley’s Haas School of Business, Singh laid the groundwork for a career destined for greatness.\nBefore Quantumscape, Singh cut his teeth at tech giants like Sun Microsystems and Ciena, gaining the experience that would later fuel his entrepreneurial ventures. From co-founding AirSoft to launching Infinera, Singh’s career has been a masterclass in chasing the future before it arrives.\nIn 2010, Singh’s career took a pivotal turn when he recognized the untapped potential of battery technology in transforming the electric vehicle industry. Enter Quantumscape, a company now leading the charge in revolutionizing EV battery innovation.\nBacked by heavyweights like Volkswagen and Bill Gates, Quantumscape became a beacon of the EV industry, pushing boundaries and delivering cutting-edge tech that’s shaping the cars of tomorrow. Singh’s visionary leadership didn’t just make Quantumscape a success; it made him the highest-paid employee globally.\nSingh’s record-breaking compensation package wasn’t just handed over on a silver platter. It was tied to ambitious performance goals, a bold, multi-billion-dollar deal that reflected the immense value he brought to Quantumscape. It wasn’t just about running a company; it was about transforming an industry.\nEven after stepping down as CEO in 2024, Singh’s drive hasn’t slowed down. Now the CEO of a stealth startup (because apparently, the EV industry wasn’t enough), he’s already working on disrupting new sectors.\nSo, the next time you need a little inspiration (or a reminder to update your LinkedIn profile), just think about the man who went from coding in classrooms to redefining industries, and earning ₹48 crore a day while at it.

This means that even our culture is something that we deeply love, despite the flaws; and there’s no denying that there are a lot of flaws. So much of the desi culture boils down to pretending that we are better than the rest, it’s as if we are constantly competing. A lot of our ideas and opinions are problematic in ways that they harm all of us. Yet, we don’t let them go.\nSome people shared similar instances and ideas of our culture that are deeply toxic:\n1. “The idea that we have to respect people who are older than us – relatives and family members, solely because they’re older in age. When in fact, the basis for respect should be an individual’s personality – it should depend on how they are as human beings.”\n– Anonymous\n2. “You cannot have a male friend without the family assuming that you’re in a relationship. This is especially true for women, their friendships with men are ruined because of this regressive mindset.\n– Aaliyah Jain\n3. “People think that there’s a specific age bar to get married. So, anytime you reach anywhere nearer that age, relatives and family members start pestering you. This is pressuring and wrong.”\n– Naman Issar\n4. “So many parents make it a point to show that they’re doing a favour when they’re there for the children. Most things they do, they do it as an obligation. The mentality that raising a child is a favour is so toxic – it’s a choice. Children should not be shown that they owe their parents something because they chose to raise a child.”\n– Manya\n5. “Our society spends too much money on weddings. This is mostly done to show off – and it’s problematic. In some cases, people start saving money for the women’s wedding when they’re kids. All of this for someone else, when this money could actually be used for the kids’ future or as an investment.\n– Izhan Saifi\n6. “Gossiping is neither normal, nor okay. I don’t understand why desi culture has normalized it.”\n– Shantanu Ghosh\n7. “The idea that parents’ love is unconditional, is flawed. They say that they’ll love us for who we are, despite everything. However, it mostly comes down to their terms. They love us when we live on their terms, when we make them happy by doing things they like. They don’t love us for who we are.”\n– Anonymous\n8. “We can hardly take other people doing well. Everything is a competition with us, and we only feel like we are successful when other people around us aren’t doing better than us. I’ve hardly seen people being genuinely happy for someone else’s success. This competition is ingrained in our mentality.”\n– Riya Gill\n9. “We’re so into pleasing others, and looking a certain way that we don’t even leave situations like a death of someone close. Our rituals and the idea of having to serve “good food” are deeply toxic.”\n– Harshit Ailawadi\n\n10. “You’re expected to follow the guidance of your elder siblings out of respect.

The minute something becomes outdated, it’s replaced—sometimes in a flash. The latest victim of this relentless cycle is TikTok, a platform that, just a few days ago, boasted a massive following of 170 million users in the United States.\nBut with a looming US ban on the horizon, many TikTokers, also referred to as “TikTok Refugees”, are packing up and heading to this new Chinese app, RedNote (also known as Xiaohongshu in China). And guess what? It’s taking over big and fast. The app saw almost 3 million users registering in one day!\nAmericans are currently facing a digital crisis as there are reports that TikTok will shut down its operations in the country after a federal ban was imposed on the Chinese company during Biden’s rule. ByteDance had nine months to find a US-approved buyer or risk closure under a bipartisan law signed by President Joe Biden and ratified by Congress in April 2024. Described as, “a national-security threat of immense depth and scale,” by the US Justice Department, ByteDance faced allegations of giving up user data belonging to Americans to the Chinese government. TikTok and ByteDance vehemently refuse this accusation.\nThe method of collecting data, data privacy, and algorithmic content delivery were the staggering points of concern for the US government as it was used by almost 170 million users in America. But even before America found the security implications of the application on privacy and security, many other governments had banned the app, including India.\nHowever, the irony is undeniable as users moved on to another Chinese-language app, RedNote as the replacement for TikTok. Within just a couple of days, RedNote skyrocketed to the top of app store download charts. The app was already seeing a rise in popularity with about 3.4 million daily active users in the US on January 15. Just the day before, that number was a mere 700,000. It’s clear – Americans were in full crisis mode, searching for something to fill the void TikTok was about to leave behind.\nThe app, initially built to be a lifestyle and e-commerce platform in China, serves as a kind of mix between Instagram and Pinterest, with a heavy focus on sharing content like lifestyle tips, fashion, beauty, food, and travel. It’s got all the elements people crave when they’re looking to kill time: pretty pictures, fun trends, short-form videos, and the virality of TikTok. It has a built-in e-commerce platform that allows users to shop directly. As per reports, Shanghai-based Xingyin Information Technology Co., Ltd. is the owner of RedNote. Thus, in a technical sense, the Chinese government does not own it. However, Chinese legislation gives the government extensive control over every aspect of business activities.\nWhat’s fascinating about this sudden surge is not just the rise of a new app but the clear reflection of social media addiction. Here’s the thing: Social media is no more just a time-filler; it’s a part of life or sometimes, the whole life of a person. People go to these platforms to escape, to entertain themselves, and sometimes, to find community or validation. It’s become such a deep part of daily life that even the thought of losing access to it – like the possibility of TikTok being banned, sparks near-panic among millions of users. Just like TikTok Refugees flooding to RedNote.\nIn this case, RedNote is the beneficiary of TikTok’s downfall, but who knows? If RedNote faces its own issues in the future, another platform will likely be waiting in the wings. The digital world is full of these cycles—rising, falling, and being replaced at the speed of light. RedNote is taking over, and it might very well be the next big thing in social media in the US But the larger question remains: How long before this cycle repeats itself again?'], 'https://www.scoopwhoop.com/career/traffic-signs-and-symbols-quiz/?ref=home_read': ['This Quiz On Traffic Signs Is So Hard, It’ll ‘Drive’ You Crazy', "\nIf you consider yourself a great driver, then you're likely to know and be able to identify most traffic signs/ sign boards.\n\n\nvia GIPHY\n\nHere, try it out and see if you know what these traffic signs mean!

In fact, some fans and critics have called it the worst year for Indian OTT since Sacred Games brilliantly kicked off this trend back in 2018. However, we have witnessed two great shows in the first 3 weeks of the new year itself. Vikramaditya Motwane’s Black Warrant and Sudip Sharma’s Paatal Lok season 2 have already set the bar astronomically high, and it’s not even the end of January.\nSo naturally, the fans are expecting more such path-breaking shows to come in the later days of the year. With the sequels to some of the most popular shows in India to some freshly brewed ideas, it looks like we won’t have to settle for mediocre stuff in 2025. From thrillers to superheroes, from treasure hunts to slice-of-life, the upcoming releases are of different genres and flavors, catering to multiple taste pallets.\nHere’s a list of the shows we are most excited about in 2025.\nLet me list the reasons why I will be watching The Secret Of The Shiledars – a treasure hunt, a thriller revealing secrets of some of the most prominent kings from the 17th century, and most importantly, Rajeev Khandelwal. As a character in the trailer says, “This is like an Indiana Jones movie”, the show has thematic similarities to National Treasure and the Harrison Ford starring franchise. Based on the book Pratipashchandra and directed by Munjya‘s maker Aditya Sarpotdar, the show drops on Hotstar on the 31st of January.\nArguably the most anticipated show of 2025. It was only yesterday that the creators Raj and DK gave an update that they have wrapped up the new season. So we are assuming it’s just a matter of months now before we get to see the return of Srikant Tiwari’s new adventures, this time more thrilling and on a scale never seen before.\nFew shows in our country have garnered the kind of love and universal appeal that Panchayat has managed to. A massive hit in Northern India, now the show has come up with its South Indian version. Abhishek has become Shayam, Phulera in UP has been replaced by a village in Telangana, and the protagonist is taking GMAT instead of CAT. However, the fun remains the same. It started streaming on Prime Video from the 24th of January.\nThe much-awaited unnamed directorial debut of SRK’s son is set to release in 2025. Produced by Gauri Khan, not much information is available about the release date right now, but that doesn’t lessen our excitement even a bit.\nAfter its stellar first two seasons, the International Emmy winner is scheduled to release its next season in 2025. Created by Richie Mehta and starring Shefali Shah, Rasika Dugal, and Rajesh Tailang among others, the new season is rumored to come on Netflix somewhere in the middle of the year.\nSet in 1960s Bombay, Dabba Cartel is the story of five housewives who run a secret cartel. Their modus operandi – the famous dabbas that are one of the identities of the city itself. Starring Shabana Azmi, Jyotika, Shalini Pandey, Sai Tamhankar, Nimisha Sajayan, Anjali Anand, Gajraj Rao, and Jisshu Sengupta the series is produced by Excel Entertainment and directed by Hitesh Bhatia. It’s rumored to get its release soon on Netflix.\nThe thing I miss most about the good old days of cricket is the aggression, the banters, and the fights on the pitch. We are all set to relive one of the greatest rivalries in sports with this Netflix documentary. Can’t wait for 7th February when I get to see those Shohaib’s bouncers, Sachin’s straight drives and Gambhir-Afridi’s… you know what I mean.\nI was going to add all the Indian shows to this list, but you know what Marvel means to the Indian fans. After a series of disappointing installments of shows, the fans are excited for the return of one of the best Marvel has ever produced. Matt Murdock’s adventure continues in Daredevil: Born Again when the first episode drops on the 4th of March.\nEver heard about Matka gambling? Well, it was a rage in Bombay in the 60s. Matka King is the story of a cotton merchant who introduced a new gambling game called Matka. Its popularity increased among the common people and challenged the monopoly of the rich and the elite. Starring Vijay Varma, Sai Tamhankar, and Kritika Kamra, the show is directed by the Nagraj Manjule and is set for a release date later this year.\nExciting times are ahead for lovers of visual storytelling.

The process is frustrating, and people definitely don’t make it easy. There are hardly any major chains that allow unmarried couples to book a room together. This, of course, stems from the regressive mindset of our society. However, not being able to book a room at a trustworthy group also means an unsafe experience. So, this is a more important issue than we give it credit for.\nKeeping that in mind, we have made a list of hotel chains that won’t judge you for being with your partner.\n1. Stay Uncle\nThe platform offers hotel booking services with a focus on providing safe and comfortable accommodations for couples in India. The chain even insists at creating a sex-positive space, which is free of judgement. In doing that, it promotes a safe stay for couples who aren’t married. Stay Uncle has hotels in over 40 cities, and it’s ever expanding.\n2. FabHotels\nFabHotels is another chain that is couple-friendly. The hotel group is safe for couples who are unmarried and offers a reliable stay. The booking process is quite simple for this one, so its accessibility is better than a lot of similar chains. There are a list of hotels in different Indian cities, which helps with accommodation when you’re travelling for leisure.\n3. OYO Rooms\nOYO Rooms is probably one of the most known chains when it comes to hotel stay that is safe and easy for couples who are unmarried. The good part about most of the hotels under the chain is that they are affordable – this increases the accessibility which a lot of hotel chains lack.\n4. Brevistay\nBrevistay has short-stay accommodations, primarily for couples and travelers looking for flexible booking options. The chain offers a number of options in terms of budget, location, and amenities. To make the entire stay and process more comfortable, they have flexible check-in and check-out timings. So, it’s the customers who have control over their stay, and not the other way round.\n5. Mistay\nThis is also a hotel booking platform with flexible check-in and check-out timings. This means that MiStay specializes in enabling travelers, especially couples to reserve hotel rooms for precise timeframes. This makes it perfect for brief stays, stopovers, and different lodging needs. According to the platform, the options are affordable, so booking a hotel with the platform does not come with a significant financial burden.\n6. LuvStay\nLuvStay is known for being couple-friendly and aims to create a comfortable and non-judgmental environment for unmarried couples. The booking platform also offers an app which makes the process simpler. The chain is said to be one of the groups that has finally come up with safe and secure living situations for couples who are unmarried.\n7. Treebo Hotels\nWhile the group had initially started as a hotel chain for travellers, it also included couple friendly hotels under the name. The idea behind the hotel chain’s step is that moral policing often ruins vacation or travel experience for couples who aren’t married. There are hotels in different cities, so that’s another plus.\nWhile nothing changes how unmarried couples are treated for living together in our society, this is the bare minimum that can help.'], 'https://www.scoopwhoop.com/entertainment/10-instances-that-prove-chris-martin-is-a-pookie/?ref=home_read': ['10 Instances That Prove Chris Martin Is An Absolute Dakota-Coded Pookie', "It has been 10 days since I attended Coldplay’s Mumbai concert.

People make superstars out of them while generally ignoring the people behind the instruments. Certainly, jo dikhta hai wohi bikta hai, but the man on the drum or the guitar contributes equally to creating a band’s aura and magic. However, I think I can make an exception for Chris Martin.\nI don’t know how Chris manages to do this, but even in a packed stadium, it feels like Chris is talking straight to you. Of course, the entire concert is an elaborate effort of hundreds of people to make the audience feel wholesome, but I don’t think it would be possible without the sheer warmth Chris exudes.

The video has now gone viral, serving as a wake-up call to all of us who think we’re “too smart” to fall for scams.\nA post shared by Instagram (@instagram)\nIt began with an innocent-sounding automated call after Ankush returned from the gym. The call claimed his courier had been canceled and urged him to press “zero for support.” And like many of us would, he did. The person on the other end alleged that Ankush’s package contained illegal items and had been seized by customs. To make matters worse, the scammer “verified” Ankush’s name and Aadhaar number, making it seem terrifyingly legit.\nThe scammers told Ankush he was under “digital arrest” and that an arrest warrant had been issued in his name.

In 2011, A Raja was placed in judicial custody at Tihar Jail.\nThe second episode of Black Warrant is one of the most haunting pieces of filmmaking I have seen in my life, and the episode deals with the infamous execution of Ranga-Billa. Kuljeet Singh (alias\xa0Ranga Khus) and Jasbir Singh (alias Billa) were involved in the kidnapping and subsequent murder of siblings Geeta and Sanjay. I won’t tell much about the case, but the episode is a must-watch.\nOnce a prominent politician, Suresh Kalmadi’s involvement in the Commonwealth Games 2010 scam led to his arrest and imprisonment in Tihar Jail in 2011. He was accused of giving out a  ₹141 Cr contract to Swiss Timing for its timing equipment. The deal was said to be inflated by Rs 95 crores.\nDecember 16, 2012, is one of the darkest days of our nation’s history. Nearly 7 years after the incident, the four men convicted for the 2012 Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case were executed in Tihar Jail.\nOlympic medallist Sushil Kumar was arrested along with his associates for allegedly thrashing and killing Sagar Dhankar, \xa0a young athlete. After being imprisoned\xa0in Tihar Jail in connection he started working as a fitness and wrestling coach for prison inmates.\nYes, our beloved flying Sikh. You must have heard a lot of politicians and activists going to Tihar, but you don’t expect someone so revered like Milkha to be there. As the story goes, he was sent to the Tihar Jail once for traveling without a ticket on a train. It is also said his sister sold her jewellery for Milkha’s bail.\nThere are, of course, countless others, some of whose names might surprise you.

However, the enthusiasm is not just limited to India. Recently, Amazon Australia and NZ released a series of ads where Australian skipper Pat Cummins is seen preparing for the tournament. One of the ads had him preparing how to sledge in front of a mirror.\nThis ad reminded me of the countless cricket ads, some featuring cricketers, some with common people, and some with cartoons, that perfectly built up the excitement and tension around a tournament. Here are some of the best and our favourite ads around cricket which we have seen in the recent times.\nMy favorite ad campaign of all time came during the 2011 World Cup. In a series of ads, Pepsi imagined how some of the most iconic shots, gestures, and bowling actions in cricket could have been invented. From Sehwag’s uppercut to MS Dhoni’s helicopter shot, from Harbhajan’s doosra to Umpire Billy Bowden’s unique style of giving out, the campaign completely blew my pre-teen-cricket-manic self.\nWhenever there’s an India vs Pakistan match nowadays, you can see brands leaving no stone unturned to show their presence on social media. However, in terms of capturing the essence of the rivalry, none of them come as close to being iconic as the series of Mauka Mauka ads. Such was the popularity of the series that they kept producing its sequels whenever this particular match was scheduled in a WC, until 2021.\nIPL is celebrated as a festival in our country, and the ‘king of good times’ gave us one of the most memorable jingles from this tournament. I remember the tagline “Divided by teams, united by Kingfisher” being highlighted in the ads when all our favourite cricketers used to sing this in unison.\nYou must remember the Dravid one where ‘The Wall’ uncharacteristically becomes part of a road rage. With the bat in his hand and coming out of the sunroof of his car, he shouts, “Indiranagar ka gunda hai main.” However, there was also another ad in this campaign where Kapil Dev behaves like Ranveer Singh. In a different ad, some former cricketers were imagined to be part of a boy band.\nThough technically not an ad featuring the elements or superstars of cricket, you can’t leave ZooZoos out when talking about cricket ads. Those adorable creatures sometimes became more entertaining than the match itself. I remember eagerly waiting for these ads to come in between the break, even if it meant the dismissal of my favourite batsman.\nEven if you missed this epic ad when it used to air during the 2015 WC, the song has lately been famous on Instagram reels. 2015 was a unique World Cup, it was the first time we consumed this grand event live on our phone screens. So this song was a perfect blend of changing times and the changing nature of the game.\nYou all must have seen the iconic Dairy Milk ad where a woman dances her way into the cricket ground after a player hits the ball out of the park. Cadbury decided to bring this ad back a few years ago. They reversed the gender, now it was a girl who hit the six, and a boy dances and enters the field. However, we are glad that they left the music untouched.\nBefore Adidas took over as the kit manufacturer of the Indian Cricket Team, we saw Nike’s swoosh on the Indian jersey all our childhood. During the 2011 World Cup, Nike came up with a brilliant ad campaign called ‘Yards’ that beautifully captures what cricket means to Indians. Even after 14 years, I still get goosebumps watching it.\nNowadays, whenever the cast of an old movie reunites, instead of getting excited we get frustrated as we already know it would be for an ad campaign. However, nearly 2 years ago, when Dream 11 came up with the cast of 3 Idiots, it was such a novel concept. They seamlessly blended cricket with Bollywood, the two most popular things in our country.\n\n'], 'https://www.scoopwhoop.com/entertainment/elon-musk-problematic/?ref=read_hot?ref=read_masthead': ['Here Are Some Reality Checks For People Who Hero-Worship Elon Musk, The Guy Who Keeps Faltering', 'Elon Musk might have achieved several feats throughout his career, however, it is essential to step away from worshipping him like a hero and examine his actions. It is now high time to assess the man behind the massive headlines and discuss the reality.\nIn the list below, we have mentioned some compelling reasons why people should stop treating this business magnate like a hero. Read on.\n1. He’s a man-child.\nFrom changing its name and charging $8 per month for blue ticks to changing the iconic blue bird to the viral doge, the man has made a joke of his micro-blogging website, Twitter. Recently, the man shared a private picture of his ex, Amber Heard, dressed as a video game character. I mean how childish and ridiculous a man can get?\n2. He has made some very insensitive statements.\nThe man, on several occasions, has said some heartless things. In 2020, he called the people ‘dumb’ to worry about the deadly coronavirus. In 2022, when Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, he came up with a bizarre list of suggestions to solve the war, through an insensitive poll on Twitter.\n3. He’s sexist and homophobic.\nNeedless to mention, he also has a terrible sense of humor. In 2021, he proposed opening a school called the Texas Institute Of Technology & Science. To this, a person suggested swapping the words ‘technology’ and ‘science’. The magnate declined and said that he wanted the name to begin with the letter T – that’s because the school’s name makes the acronym TITS. He has also made some homophobic statements over time and made fun of people for writing pronouns in their social media bios.\n4. He has no respect for his own employees.\nIt’s 2023 and the man is still promoting the toxic hustle culture. Last year, in 2022, his employees received an ultimatum from him at two in the morning which stated that their work lives would look very different now. His email said that the employees can either commit to the new ‘hardcore culture’ or leave with three months’ notice. In another instance, he laid off the janitors from his office and made the employees bring their own toilet paper. He also fired an engineer over his low reach on Twitter.\nIt’s high time that we stop hailing a man-child like him as a hero!'], 'https://www.scoopwhoop.com/entertainment/quiz-would-you-qualify-as-client-for-sima-taparia/?ref=home_read': ['Take This Quiz To Know If You’d Qualify As A Client For Master Matchmaker Sima Taparia', "\nPeople either love or love to hate the Netflix reality sensation\xa0Indian Matchmaking,\xa0you know the face of the show,\xa0Sima Taparia\xa0from Mumbai.\nShe loves her bright outfits, spoilt entitled male clients, and cringe-worthy pearls of wisdom.

Recently, unverified videos of hospitals across China have emerged showing overcrowded emergency rooms due to the alleged spread of HMPV. The visuals, reminiscent of the early days of COVID-19 have raised global concerns, with panic among the masses.\nWhile there is no official information from the WHO regarding the cases, the internet is circulating with a lot of reports about the virus and its potential risk. Here is everything you need to know about the virus, its symptoms, transmission, treatments, prevention, and the current situation in India.\nAccording to the Cleveland Clinic, human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a virus causing symptoms similar to a cold. The cases are usually mild and children, those with weakened immune systems, and adults over the age of 65 face a higher risk of contracting such diseases. It was first identified in 2001 and generally causes both lower and upper respiratory tract infections.\nThe symptoms of HMPV are very similar to those of the common cold and include cough, fever, runny or stuffy nose, sore throat, wheezing, shortness of breath, and even rash. Severe cases can escalate to serious respiratory diseases pneumonia, asthma flare-ups, or make chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) worse, requiring medical intervention. The mild cases last for a few days or a week, whereas serious cases can last longer. People are more likely to get sick the first time, therefore children are at more risk. Later getting some immunity, they develop only mild symptoms if they the HMPV next time.\nThe spread of the virus occurs through respiratory droplets getting transferred through coughing or sneezing. It can also travel through close personal contact through handshakes or hugs or coming in direct contact with contaminated surfaces such as railings, handles, knobs, or washroom basins.\nThere aren’t any antiviral medications that treat HMPV. Mild symptoms are usually manageable at home, however, serious complications require hospital admission and remain under constant care. No antibiotics have yet proven to treat HMPV, since it is a virus.\nThe transmission, however, can be prevented with care and precautions.\nAt the time of writing, India has officially reported two cases of HMPV in Bengaluru – a 3-month-old and an 8-month-old. However, the infants have no travel history. According to ICMR, “It is emphasized that HMPV is already in circulation globally, including in India, and cases of respiratory illnesses associated with HMPV have been reported in various countries.” However, the top medical body also noted that India is well-equipped to handle any potential increase in illnesses. As of Friday, the Union Health Ministry also stated that it was closely monitoring the alleged outbreak of Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) in China.'], 'https://www.scoopwhoop.com/watch/?ref=sticky_nav': ['Models Vs Me: Clothes From Sarojini Nagar', ''], 'https://www.scoopwhoop.com/show/broadies/?ref=home_read': ['For The First Time', ''], 'https://www.scoopwhoop.com/entertainment/usha-uthup-kanjeevaram-sneakers/?ref=home_read': ['Usha Uthup Ditched Stilettos For Kanjeevaram Sneakers & Honestly, That’s The Kind Of Energy We Need', 'For over five decades, Usha Uthup has ruled our hearts with her soulful voice, larger-than-life stage presence, and iconic sarees.

Her travels alone cost her a fortune, with flights setting her back ₹5 lakh and trips like South Africa with her parents reaching ₹8 lakh.\nHowever, the real kicker? She also splurged ₹22 lakh on a new Hyundai car and spent ₹5 lakh on medical expenses her insurance didn’t cover. Surprisingly, she admitted she didn’t even include costs for food, shopping, or daily expenses in her calculations.\nIn the reel, Sharanya explained that this massive shift in her spending philosophy came after years of being an “obsessive saver.” She credited her dad and friends for pushing her to loosen her purse strings and embrace a more joyful approach to life, calling it a “significant move” that helped her get through a difficult year. While her admission of spending ₹50 lakh on travel and lifestyle changes was meant to inspire, it left the internet divided.\nA post shared by Instagram (@instagram)\nHer post quickly went viral, amassing over 1.3 million views and countless reactions. Some were curious about her finances, asking questions like, “What’s your source of income?” Others couldn’t wrap their heads around her budget, particularly how she managed three trips to Iceland for just ₹2.5 lakh. Sharanya responded to one such comment, explaining that parts of her Iceland trips were sponsored, and she excluded flight costs.\nBut not all reactions were positive. Many questioned the sustainability of such extravagant spending, with one user humorously pointing out, “Finance influencers are experiencing trauma after this reel.” Still, some applauded her bold approach, agreeing that sometimes, it’s okay to prioritize experiences over savings.\nSharanya’s reel also touched on her decision to focus on cutting down material spending in 2025, a move that seems ironic considering her lavish 2024. But hey, if anyone’s living the dream of turning wanderlust into a lifestyle, it’s her.\nSo, would you blow ₹50 lakh in a year to chase your adventures, or are you more team save every penny?

Nowadays, people need their morning dose of Instagram right after waking, even with squinted eyes. In this era of social media where likes and shares have become the currency of validation, you must be hardly seeing anyone around without a smartphone.\nHowever, there are some celebrities, who are not the biggest fan of smartphones. Forget smartphones, some of them are averse to using cell phones of any kind altogether. Despite being in show business, from cinema to sports, and often appearing on our phone screens, they have chosen a rather tech-free life. Professional disturbances, personal distraction – the reasons are many, but here’s a list of some of them who have escaped our favourite little black mirrors.\nIn a world where an actor’s stardom decides the box office of a movie, few directors pull crowds to the theaters. And Nolan’s name arguably would top that list. However, I was shocked to learn that the influential director doesn’t use a smartphone. Not only that, he doesn’t have an email ID and refrains from using the internet. He has also banned the use of phones on his sets, for the cast and crew.\nThe Shape of You singer revealed that he decided not to keep a phone in 2015 because he was losing real-life interaction. his team gives him a phone when needed. He explained that the constant back-and-forth of messaging and the pressure of responding on time led him to adopt a phone-free lifestyle.\nThe singing sensation once revealed that he doesn’t have a mobile phone, instead, he uses an\xa0iPad\xa0for communication. Bieber said he does this to limit the means of communication, “I definitely learned how to have boundaries, and I just don’t feel like I owe anybody anything,”\nThe veteran actor of Dune and Pulp Fiction said that he continues to embrace a tech-free lifestyle. He doesn’t use a cell phone and watches movies and shows on physical DVDs. He says he has never used emails or Twitter.\nThe Kahaani and Jagga Jasoos actor said in an interview that he once bought a smartphone and had WhatsApp and Instagram accounts made. However, he rarely used to check them because he felt they were distracting him from life and work. Now if he goes to a remote area, he carries a simple phone.\nThe CEO of Berkshire Hathaway and a minor owner of Apple shares was a long-term user of a $20 (1,438 approximately) Samsung SCH-U320 flip phone. He finally decided to ditch his old and upgraded to an iPhone 11 in 2020 at the age of 89.\nWell, we had to mention MS on this list because of all the anecdotes we hear from his team-mates. They say it’s practically impossible to contact him via a phone when MS is away. The former Indian captain had said in an event in 2023, “I do have a phone but I use it only to set an alarm at night. It does the job of waking me up in the morning.” He was recently seen using a smartphone in a practice session, but many fans pointed out that he was just swiping notifications.\nRare video of MS Dhoni using Mobile that too in the net session 😁❤️#MSDhoni #IPl2025 pic.twitter.com/0IgzQi2QZz\nMusic legend Sir Elton John has been vocal about his disdain for cell phones over the years. He does not even own a mobile phone and says that his husband David Furnish runs his Instagram. He credits his social media presence to his team. “I don’t have a phone. The office staff runs Twitter for me. I don’t do it myself,” Elton once said.\nThe star of Divergent and The Fault in Our Stars revealed way back that she was not a big technology fan. In fact, she revealed that she didn’t even have a cellphone. Shailene said that if she were to have a phone, it would have been a flip one. According to her, there’s a lack of privacy, camaraderie, and community than there’s ever been, which is one of the reasons for her decision.\nWell, to most of us dropping off our smartphones sounds like a nightmare. However, if we took some time off doom-scrolling, the world may appear a little less doomed.\n'], 'https://www.scoopwhoop.com/author/vidushi-gupta/?ref=home_read': ['Vidushi Gupta', ''], 'https://www.scoopwhoop.com/originals/men-try-identifying-women-s-intimate-products-part-2/?ref=home_read': ['Men Try Identifying Women’s Intimate Products Part 2', ''], 'https://www.scoopwhoop.com/author/needhi-roy/?ref=home_read': ['Needhi Roy', ''], 'https://www.scoopwhoop.com/category/relationships/?ref=nav_links': ['Sex and Relationships', ''], 'https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7lmZqhJeTzeQQkqNvfmjqw': 'Error: Could not find an article title', 'https://www.scoopwhoop.com/?ref=nav_list': ['7 Couple-Friendly Hotel Chains That Won’t Judge You For Being With Your Partner', ''], 'https://www.scoopwhoop.com/read/?ref=nav_top': ['14 ‘Woke Feminists’ Reveal Why ‘Animal’ Is The\xa0Best Film\xa0Indian Cinema Has Given Us\xa0In A Long Time', ''], 'https://www.scoopwhoop.com/category/life/?ref=home_read': ['Life', ''], 'https://www.scoopwhoop.com/author/snigdha-oreya/?ref=home_read': ['Snigdha Nalini Oreya', ''], 'https://www.scoopwhoop.com/privacy-policy/?ref=nav_links': ['Privacy Policy', ''], 'https://www.scoopwhoop.com/category/news/?ref=nav_links': ['Viral', ''], 'https://www.scoopwhoop.com/privacy-policy/?ref=footer_links': ['Privacy Policy', ''], 'https://www.scoopwhoop.com/category/humor/?ref=nav_links': ['Humor', ''], 'https://www.scoopwhoop.com/spotlight/?ref=nav_top': ['Spotlight', ''], 'https://www.scoopwhoop.com/category/lgbt/?ref=nav_links': ['LGBTQIA', ''], 'https://www.scoopwhoop.com/in-other-news/weirdest-things-ever-auctioned-for-unbelievable-prices/?ref=home_read': ['10 Weirdest Things Ever Auctioned for Unbelievable Prices', 'Let’s talk about rich people. You know, the ones who could casually buy an island on a Tuesday and still have enough money left over for a private jet and a pet tiger. While I am out here comparing grocery prices and deciding whether I really need that extra cup of coffee, there’s a whole other world where people are spending insane amounts of money on things that make absolutely no sense (or at least to me).\nI am not talking about luxury cars, designer clothes, or expensive watches, those, at least, serve a purpose. No, I am talking about the kind of purchases that make you question everything – Why? Things so absurd, so bizarre, so utterly useless that you can’t help but wonder: Who in their right mind would spend money on this? But the answer is always the same – someone did. Someone woke up one and thought, “Yes, I absolutely need to own this.” Maybe it’s because they’re superfans. Maybe because they wanted to own a piece of history. Or maybe it’s just because they could. So here are 10 unbelievable things that were auctioned for unbelievable prices.\nThe legendary British Prime Minister had false teeth, and guess what? He had multiple sets because he kept throwing or breaking them when he was pissed off. One of these very Gold-mounted false teeth sets was auctioned off for £18,000 or $22400 or ₹19 lakh in Cheltenham. Somebody, somewhere, owns Winston Churchill’s rage-damaged dentures. Let that sink in.\nA true Beatles fan will go to great lengths to prove their devotion. In 2010, someone spent £9,500 ($11,800 or ₹10 lakh) on John Lennon’s personal porcelain throne. Imagine proudly telling your guests, “This is where John Lennon sat… to do his business.” Hopefully, they at least cleaned it before shipping it out.\nThe King of Rock ’n’ Roll left behind a legacy of music, style, and… hair? A lock of Elvis Presley’s hair, lovingly saved by his personal barber, was auctioned for £4,000 (almost $5000 or ₹4 lakh). Honestly, that’s a steal compared to some of the other things on this list. Imagine someone proudly displaying that in their living room. “Oh yeah, that’s Elvis’ DNA sitting right there on my shelf.”\nNothing says “historical collector” like spending £12,000 (₹13 lakh or almost $15000) on Queen Victoria’s secret. Queen Victoria’s perfectly preserved undies, embroidered with “VR” for Victoria Regina, were sold at auction in 2015. If this doesn’t scream Victorian obsession, I don’t know what does. Well, they must have been a very enthusiastic history buff to admire a pair of 19th-century royal bloomers.\nHow much do you love cats? Probably not as much as the billionaire who spent nearly a million dollars, $826,000 or ₹7.23 crores on a painting of cats. Not just any painting this beast of a canvas weighed 227 pounds and required a reinforced wall to be displayed. Oh to be the guests, walking into someone’s house and being greeted by a giant cat mural that cost more than most people’s homes. Priorities, man.\nMarilyn Monroe was one of the most glamorous women in history, but instead of a dress or a letter, someone decided they just had to have her medical X-rays. For a whopping $45,000 or almost ₹39 lakh, a lucky buyer walked away with literal proof of her bones. What do you even do with an X-ray of Marilyn Monroe? Hang it up? Frame it? Show it off at dinner parties?\nDigital artist Guo O Dong wanted to make a statement about how dangerous the internet can be, so he purposely loaded a laptop with six of the world’s deadliest computer viruses. He called it The Persistence of Chaos, and someone paid $1.3 million or ₹11 crores for it. A million bucks for a laptop that you literally cannot turn on without the risk of global cyber doom! A bold investment, to say the least.\nFor some bizarre reason, Adolf Hitler’s artwork still gets auctioned off, and in 2015, someone actually dropped almost half a million dollars or ₹3.9 crores on a collection of his watercolor paintings. What were the subjects? Castles and flowers. Not exactly what you’d expect, huh? Not sure who would want to own that kind of historical artifact, but hey, to each their own.\nThe ultimate art world prank happened in 2018 when Banksy’s famous Girl with a Balloon was auctioned for $1.4 million or ₹12 lakh. But to everyone’s surprise, it was instantly shredded by a built-in device inside the frame. The crowd gasped as the artwork literally destroyed itself right after being sold. But the joke’s on everyone, the shredded painting was sold for $24.5 million or 214 crores! This is proof that sometimes, the weirdest auction items only get weirder.\nOh to be so rich!\n'], 'https://www.scoopwhoop.com/category/socially-relevant/?ref=home_read': ['Socially Relevant', ''], 'https://www.scoopwhoop.com/in-other-news/salaries-of-indian-ceos/?ref=home_read': ['Here Are Salaries Of Some Indian CEOs.

Well, now we get where this motivation to motivate others to work each second of their day comes from.\nHere’s a list of the top-earning CEOs and people at the helm of companies, and the figures they made in the past years. Huh, it’s hard even to make sense and comprehend this amount of money.\nThe CEO of Cognizant is India’s highest-paid CEO.

He was succeeded by Srinivas Pallia as CEO and Managing Director in April last year.\nApart from inviting the biggest celebrities and entrepreneurs around the world to his podcast, Nikhil is also one of the highest-earning leaders in FY23. In that period, the founder and CEO of Zerodha and Rainmatter earned ₹72 Cr.\nThe CEO and Executive Director of Persistent Systems earned ₹61.7 Cr last financial year. It was a significant 31% increase from the ₹46.9 Cr that he had earned the previous year.\nThe CEO and Director of Mphasis earned ₹59.2 Cr in FY23. The Indian-American businessman has been leading Mphasis since 2017.\nThe CEO of Infosys Salil Parekh earned ₹56 crore last year in FY23. Despite this mammoth income, it was still a drop from the ₹71 Cr he earned in FY22, according to reports.\nWe have previously mentioned the huge sum the chairman of Larsen & Toubro made in FY 24. However, according to some reports, he earned a commendable ₹61.27 Cr in the previous fiscal year. Is he angry about that?\nNo wonder work-life balance seems a myth to some of them.']}}

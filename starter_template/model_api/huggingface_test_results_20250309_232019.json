        "Muhammad Yunus to visit China: Will Bangladesh help PLA, Xi Jinping surround India?",
        "WORLD\nWill Muhammad Yunus of Bangladesh help Chinese President Xi Jinping and Chinese Army the PLA to surround India from all sides? Know abut Beijing's strategy of \"String of Pearls\".\nPramode Mallik\nUpdated : Mar 07, 2025, 05:27 PM IST\nImmediately after a 21-member delegation of political leaders, civil society activists, academics and journalists returned from China after a 10-day-visit, the Chief Advisor to the Interim Bangladesh Government announced his decision to visit the South Asian country on March 26, 2025.\nMuhammad Yunus will visit China first time since he took over as the head of the government on August 7, 2024, two days after a popular protest forced then Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to flee the country and take refuge in neighbouring country India.\nThe Nobel laureate will most likely meet Chinese President Xi Jinping on March 28 at the Great Hall of the People and discuss bilateral ties.\nMuhammad Yunus To Meet Chinese President Xi Jinping\nMuhammad Yunus will begin his China visit on March 25, when he will attend the Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) conference in Hainan province. BFA Secretary General Zhang Jun invited the chief advisor to the government.\nBeijing will also host the economist known for his microcredit endeavours to commemorate 50 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries.\nAnalysts believe India may be upset over the increasing bonhomie between its neighbouring states of Bangladesh and China.\nThe meeting was announced two days after New Delhi raked up the issue of alleged persecution of minorities, including Hindus, in the South Asian country. It raised the issue at a United Nations Human Rights Council session in Geneva and pointed out that a UN fact-finding report team had found that Bangladesh \"mainstreamed\" the concept of \"revenge violence against minorities\".\nIndia Accuses Bangladesh Of Minority Persecution\nThe allegation came after hundreds of Hindus were attacked, their homes and temples ransacked and vandalized after Sheikh Hasina fled the country.\nHasina quit the office and fled Bangladesh on August 5, 2024, after thousands of people stormed her official residence, vandalized and ransacked it and looted whatever they could.\nWhen Indian Foreign Minister S Jaishankar met his UK counterpart David Lammy at Chatham House in London on March 5, Bangladesh was one of the subjects the two leaders discussed.\nPolitical analysts and geostrategic experts believe Muhammad Yunus' China visit may upset New Delhi as it may set the alarm bell ringing.\nWhy Is India Upset Over Bangladesh-China Bonhomie?\nThey point out that Beijing has been pursuing the policy of surrounding India from all sides, particularly in the Indian Ocean with its \"String of Pearls\" strategy.\nUnder the String of Pearls strategy, Beijing is aggressively developing its bases in the Indian Ocean to augment its geopolitical influence or military existence spreading from Hainan Island to Gwadar Port in the Pakistani province of Balochistan.\nThe significance of this strategy can be gauged by the fact that the Chinese initiative is to create a network of ports and naval bases in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) encircling India. The main ports surrounding India are Gwadar in Pakistan, Hambantota in Sri Lanka and Sittwe in Myanmar, all these are situated in the Bay of Bengal.\nThe growing defence cooperation between China and Bangladesh may also upset India.\nString Of Pearl To Surround India?\nDhaka and Bangladesh signed a landmark Defense Cooperation Agreement in 2002 when Khaleda Zia of Bangladesh Nationalist Party was the prime minister of the country.\nThis cooperation soared after her opponent and presumably pro-India Sheikh Hasina became the head of the state. She launched an ambitious modernisation plan for the Bangladesh Armed Forces in 2009 with the help of Beijing.\nBeijing supplied Ming-class diesel-electric attack submarines, Shadhinota-class C13B corvettes, MBT-2000 Type 90-II and VT-5 light tanks, HQ-7 short-range surface-to-air missiles, and dozens of F-7BGI fighter interceptors to Dhaka. It also allowed Dhaka to build a variety of Chinese small and light weapons.\nWith a change in the government that is allegedly tilted towards anti-India elements like China and Pakistan, it may gain new heights, creating further problems for New Delhi.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

Moreover, Hindus residing there must perform a \"puja\" with complete secrecy, without drawing attention.\nMeemansa Shekhawat\nUpdated : Mar 08, 2025, 07:10 AM IST\nAs Hindus are spread across various countries around the globe, Hindu temples exist in several places all around the world. However, in one of India's neighbouring country itself, building a Hindu temple is prohibited. Moreover, Hindus residing there must perform a \"puja\" with complete secrecy, without drawing attention.\nNo, we're talking about Pakistan or Bangladesh - which recently witnessed violence against minority communities including the Hindus. Well, it might surprise you that this country, once home to Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms, has banned Hindu temples today.\nThe country is question is Maldives. As per the constitution of Maldives, all citizens must be Muslim. The country - a popular tourist destination - imposes strict laws against non-Muslim religious practices.\nEnforces strict laws against non-Muslim practices\nMaldives, boasting a population of\u00a0 around 5,50,000, comprises of thousands of foreign workers from countries like India and Sri Lanka. Despite its international workforce, Maldives imposes religious laws strictly which makes it impossible to perform Hindu \"puja\" or celebrate Hindu festivals.\nThe country, located 400-500 kms away from India, is based near Kochi, Kerala. Despite its proximity to India, the religious laws pose a stark contrast when compared with religious freedom in India.\nMaldivian constitution, amended in 2008, declared the country as a 100 per cent Muslim nation. As per the article 9 of the constitution, only a Muslim can be a Maldivian citizen. Furthermore, public displays of any non-Islamic religious practices is banned.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "INDIA\nTwo women, including an Israeli national, were allegedly raped by three men near the Hampi heritage site in Karnataka's Vijayanagara district on the night of March 6, Koppal Police said on Saturday.\nSonali Sharma\nUpdated : Mar 08, 2025, 09:37 PM IST\nKarnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Saturday termed the Hampi rape incident a 'heinous crime,' and directed the police officials to take immediate action against the accused. Two women, including an Israeli national, were allegedly raped by three men near the Hampi heritage site in Karnataka's Vijayanagara district on the night of March 6, Koppal Police said on Saturday.\n\"The horrific assault and rape of an Israeli national and a homestay owner in Sanapur, Gangavati taluk, Koppal district, is a deeply heinous crime,\" Karnataka CM posted on X.\nKarnataka CM said that the police have arrested two accused, and further investigation is underway. \"As soon as the incident was reported, I directed the concerned police officials to take immediate action, conduct a stringent investigation, and swiftly apprehend the culprits. The police have already arrested two accused and are continuing the investigation,\" he added. He further said that the Karnataka government is committed to \"ensuring the safety of every individual, including tourists visiting our state.\"\n\"We will take all necessary measures to prevent such incidents from recurring,\" he said. Congress MP GC Chandrashekhar called the Hampi rape incident \"unfortunate,\" and said that the state will take action against the culprits.\n\"This is unfortunate. This should not have happened. We condemn it. Our government will definitely take action against the culprits,\" Chandrashekhar said.\nKarnataka Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar said that the police are investigating the alleged Hampi rape case and the action will be taken as per the law.\n\"I came to know about this yesterday. Two people have been recovered, and one has to be recovered. They had gone there at midnight for star watching. Police are investigating. We will take action as per the law,\" Shivakumar told reporters.\nSowmya Reddy, President of the Karnataka Mahila Congress, said that the Karnataka government is taking steps to ensure security and safety. \"I have not heard about this incident but I just want to say that in the last 11-12 years since the BJP government has come to power at the Centre, crimes against women have increased, women have become unsafe, so we demand equality, we demand security, we demand equal opportunity and I really want to say that the Karnataka government is taking steps to ensure security and safety,\" Reddy said.\nAccording to police, a 29-year-old homestay operator, three male tourists, and an Israeli tourist had gone to the Tungabhadra Canal near Sanapur Lake for stargazing. They were sitting near the canal, playing guitar and stargazing, when the accused approached them and asked where they could get petrol.\n\"On the night of March 6, after dinner, we decided to go and watch the stars at night. We took our scooters and rode to the bank of the Tungabhadra Canal, near Durgamma Gudi, near Sanapur Lake. While we were watching the stars and playing the guitar, around 10:30 pm, three men approached us on a motorcycle, asking for petrol in Kannada,\" the homestay operator alleged.\nShe told them that there was no petrol station nearby and that they could find petrol in Sanapur. One of the three men suddenly demanded 100 rupees. \"Since they did not know us, I told them that I did not have any money with me. However, as they repeatedly insisted, one of the male tourists gave them 20 rupees,\" the complainant said.\nWhen they refused to give them more money, the accused started arguing and threatening them with stones. Two of the accused allegedly assaulted and raped the homestay operator and Israeli tourist, while the third pushed the male tourists into the water canal, she said.\nAccording to the FIR, two of the accused assaulted the homestay operator, and the third man aggressively pushed the three male tourists into the canal. The accused also hit her with stones.\n\"I was seriously bleeding...Two of the accused joined forces and dragged me to the side of the canal. One of them strangled me and took off my clothes. One by one they forcibly beat me and raped me,\" the homestay operator alleged in her complaint.\nShe further said that the accused also snatched her bag and took away her two mobile phones and Rs 9500 in cash. Similarly, one of the accused dragged the Israeli tourist away and raped her.\n\"While we were screaming and crying, the three men left with their motorcycle,\" she alleged.She also mentioned that the accused spoke Kannada and Telugu and that she might be able to recognize them.\nBased on their complaint, a case has been registered at Gangavathi Rural Police Station under relevant sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) 2023, including charges of attempt to murder, robbery, and rape. Koppal Superintendent of Police Ram Arasiddi said that two suspects have been arrested in Gangavathi in connection with the case.\n\"On March 6, five people - two women and three men - were attacked by three miscreants. The attackers assaulted the three men and sexually abused the two women. Based on the victims' complaint, we have registered a case of attempted murder, robbery, and rape,\" SP Arasiddi said.\n\"Based on the information provided, we have arrested two suspects, Sai Mallu and Chethan Sai, both from Gangavathi. A third accused is still at large, but we have identified him and will catch him soon,\" he added. The police were further looking into the case.\n(This story has not been edited by DNA staff and is published from ANI)\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "BOLLYWOOD\nKiran shared that the makers in South cinema are ready to take chances as it's a small industry, and they know their audience very well.\nVarsha Agarwal\nUpdated : Mar 08, 2025, 09:25 PM IST\nFilmmaker Kiran Rao candidly discussed the Bollywood vs South Cinema debate and said that she finds a \"sense of conviction\" when it comes to telling stories in South films.\nIn a conversation with ANI, she said, \"I watch a lot of Malayalam films, and what I'm always struck by is how they really seem very bold in their story choices. 'Uleri', which was released last year, is such a bold story idea. Even their horror films, like I saw a film called 'Bramayugam,' which is a Mammootty film, incredibly artistically made using folk tales and the folklore of Kerala, and it's a very different idea. There is a sort of a sense of conviction about telling stories that are different. And I think that's what stands them in great stead.\"\nKiran, however, shared that the makers in South cinema are ready to take chances as it's a small industry, and they know their audience very well. \"It's the chances that they are taking with the stories they are telling, and perhaps that also comes from the fact that they are usually smaller industries that are technically only catering to their own, culturally, their language and their community. And so they are quite unafraid to try different things. They know their audience, and their producers are willing to take chances on new storytelling,\" she added.\nShe said what is incredible is that \"the audience is going to watch films,\" and the makers are \"very much in touch with their audience. They understand their audience very well.\" However, she shared that Bollywood is big, and while making the movie, filmmakers keep in mind that they have to cater for a \"wider audience\". \"You are making films for a diaspora, you are making films for all the states of the country. And I think maybe that is why people want to make something that they are very sure will succeed, and maybe that's why there's a tendency to go to a film that's already successful, like a remake,\" she said. She insisted that it is important to have \"producers who are willing to take a chance\" if you are willing to have a different cinema.\nRao started her career as the assistant director in the epic film 'Lagaan', directed by Ashutosh Gowariker, whom she also assisted later on 'Swades: We, the People'. Lagaan was nominated for the 74th Academy Award in the foreign language film category. Aamir Khan produced and starred in the same film. Before 'Lagaan', she also played a minute role as a supporting actress in 'Dil Chahta Hai'. She has directed the films 'Dhobi Ghat' (2011) and 'Laapataa Ladies' (2024).\n\r\n\t(This story has not been edited by DNA staff and is published from ANI)\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

This move paves the way for a comprehensive bill to be introduced in the ongoing Winter Session of Parliament. As per the latest development, the introduction of the bill has been delayed.\nAs per the revised list of business in the Lok Sabha, the two bills approved by the Union Cabinet are The Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-Ninth Amendment) Bill, 2024, and The Union Territories Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024.\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been pushing for One Nation, One Election. The Winter Session of Parliament, which started on November 25, is expected to discuss this issue before concluding on December 20.\nWhat is \u2018One Nation, One Election\u2019 bill?\nThe proposed \"One Nation, One Election\" legislation aims to synchronize elections for the Lok Sabha and state assemblies across India. This means that voters would cast their ballots for both national and state elections on the same day or within a specific timeframe. The idea behind this proposal is to reduce election costs, minimize disruptions to governance, and streamline administrative work. According to estimates, elections to the Lok Sabha and legislative assemblies cost the Election Commission of India over Rs 4,500 crore.\nHow it will change the way polls are conducted in India?\nThe proposed legislation would amend Articles 82A, 83(2), and 327 of the Constitution to enable simultaneous elections. The bill is expected to be introduced in the ongoing winter session of Parliament, which ends on December 20, 2024. Some opposition leaders have expressed concerns that the proposal could undermine federalism and the autonomy of state governments. It is believed that holding simultaneous elections would require significant logistical efforts, including the deployment of security forces and election officials. However, frequent elections which disrupted governance and development work, with simultaneous election disruptions would be minimised.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "Amid tariff war, Donald Trump hints at revisiting US-Canada border demarcation treaty",
        "WORLD\nThe report, which cited four people with firsthand knowledge of their content, on the condition of anonymity, also noted that Trump, in an early February call, challenged the border treaty between the two countries and told Trudeau he didn't like their shared water agreements.\nSagar Malik\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 08:58 AM IST\nAmid the ongoing tariff war between the two countries, US President Donald Trump, during his conversation with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, raised the point that he did not believe in the border demarcation treaty between them and wants to revise the boundary, the New York Times reported.\nThe report, which cited four people with firsthand knowledge of their content, on the condition of anonymity, also noted that Trump, in an early February call, challenged the border treaty between the two countries and told Trudeau he didn't like their shared water agreements.\nRecently, Justin Trudeau made an extraordinary statement that was largely lost in the fray of the moment, as per NYT.\r\n\t\"The excuse that he's giving for these tariffs today of fentanyl is completely bogus, completely unjustified, completely false,\" Trudeau told the news media in Ottawa.\n\"What he wants is to see a total collapse of the Canadian economy, because that'll make it easier to annex us,\" he added.\r\n\tThe conversation between Washington and Ottawa on February 3 not only included discussions on staving off tariffs on Canadian exports but Trump also laid out a long list of grievances he had with the trade relationship between the two countries, including Canada's protected dairy sector, the difficulty American banks face in doing business in Canada and Canadian consumption taxes that Trump deems unfair because they make American goods more expensive.\nNotably, the border treaty that Trump referred to was established in 1908 and finalized the international boundary between Canada, then a British dominion, and the United States, as reported by NYT.\nTrump also mentioned revisiting the sharing of lakes and rivers between the two nations, which is regulated by a number of treaties, a topic he's expressed interest in in the past.\nThe report further cited Trump's response to the media on January 7, wherein, he had said that he is planning to use \"economic force\" against Canada.\nThe persistent social media references to Canada as the \"51st state\" and Trudeau as its \"Governor\" had begun to grate both inside the Canadian government and more broadly, as reported by NYT.\nFollowing the talks between the two leaders, Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick in a conversation with Canada's finance minister, Dominic LeBlanc, issued a devastating message, according to several people familiar with the call that Trump, he said, had come to realize that the relationship between the United States and Canada was governed by a slew of agreements and treaties that were 'easy to abandon.'\nHe also wanted to eject Canada out of an intelligence-sharing group known as the 'Five Eyes' that also includes Britain, Australia and New Zealand, according to NYT.\nHe wanted to tear up the Great Lakes agreements and conventions between the two nations that lay out how they share and manage Lakes Superior, Huron, Erie and Ontario, the report further added.\nIt also noted that he is also reviewing military cooperation between the two countries, particularly the North American Aerospace Defence Command.\nA sigh of relief, however, has been that the Secretary of State Marco Rubio, has refrained from delivering threats, and recently dismissed the idea that the United States was looking at scrapping military cooperation.\nHowever, Canada's politicians across the spectrum, and Canadian society at large, are frayed and deeply concerned. Officials do not see the Trump administration's threats as empty; they see a new normal when it comes to the United States, the report added.\n\r\n\t(This story has not been edited by DNA staff and is published from ANI).\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "DNA TV Show: Shifting Lok Sabha polls 2024 focus from development to religion",
        "INDIA\nDNA Zee News anchor, Sourabh Raaj Jain today analysed the focus of Lok Sabha Elections 2024 shifting from development to Hindu-Muslim politics\nSonali Sharma\nUpdated : May 10, 2024, 12:07 AM IST\nDiscussions for the Lok Sabha polls in 2024 initially focused on growth and development. But now the focus has been shifted to the benefits from development\u2014based on categories, religions, and castes. This change brought religious issues into the campaign discourse. Sourabh Raaj Jain, anchor of DNA Zed News today, analysed how the focus of the 2024 Lok Sabha election will change from development to religion.\nSpeeches during election rallies shifted from reservations to religious reservations, and concerns regarding the division of land among various faiths surfaced. Lately, the discourse has intensified to an eighty-twenty proportions gulf, prompting conversations concerning Ghazwa-e-Hind via religious reservation.\nIt raises the fundamental question: does the Hindu-Muslim divide affect actual life, or is it confined to electoral politics?\nIn general, no party is exclusive when it comes to incorporating religious themes into politics. A review of several remarks shows that religious overtones work well for all political parties during elections.\nThe remarks made by BJP leader and Amravati candidate Navneet Rana reflect this viewpoint. Rana challenged Akbaruddin Owaisi and his brother Asaduddin Owaisi in Hyderabad, saying if police were removed from duty for 15 seconds, the brothers \"would not know from where they came and where they went\"\n\"I always stand by my statement. I am not afraid of anyone. We are committed to giving a reply to those who are working for Pakistan in India. If they will take 15 minutes, we will take 15 seconds,\" Navneet Rana said. Rana was heard saying in a video clip she posted on her X handle, tagging the Owaisi brothers, \"The younger brother says, 'Remove the police for 15 minutes so that we can show them what we can do'. I want to tell the younger brother (Akbaruddin) that it might take you 15 minutes, but it will only take us 15 seconds. It will take us all of 15 seconds if we come to the forefront.\"Reacting to BJP leader Navneet Rana's \"15-second lagenge\" remark, All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen leader Asaduddin Owaisi on Thursday asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to give her one hour instead of 15 seconds and asserted they are not \"scared\" of the BJP leader.\n\"I tell Modi ji - give her 15 seconds. What will you do? Give her 15 seconds, give her 1 hour. We, too, want to see if you have any humanity left in you. Who is scared? We are ready...If someone is making an open call for it, then so be it. PM is yours; RSS is yours; everything is yours. Do it. Who is stopping you? Tell us where we have to come, we will be there. Do it,\" Owaisi told reporters on Thursday.\nAt a meeting in 2013, Akbaruddin warned \"100 crore Hindus\" that his community would show what it could do if the police were withdrawn for '15 minutes'. After fellow party member Navneet Rana's '15 seconds lagenge' remark stoked controversy, Bharatiya Janata Party leader Madhavi Latha on Thursday said that the former wanted to convey to the citizens that it will only take 15 seconds to cast their vote, which will help the nation move towards 'Viksit Bharat'.\nSpeaking to ANI, BJP's Hyderabad Lok Sabha seat candidate, Madhavi Latha, said, \"We do not threaten anyone. We do not say to remove the police force for 15 minutes. We just want to say that you should take 15 seconds instead of 15 minutes and cast your vote. Do not go to attend provocative speeches. If you want to move towards 'Viksit Bharat'. Go and cast your vote. This is what she (Navneet Rana) meant.\nAsaduddin Owaisi, the leader of AIMIM and a four-time member of the Lok Sabha, presents a difficult opponent for Latha. This is the first time a female candidate from the Hyderabad constituency has been fielded by the BJP. The Owaisi family has maintained a stronghold in Hyderabad.\nIt is noteworthy that in 2022, the Sessions Court cleared Akbaruddin of all charges despite his 2013 speech earning him a 40-day jail sentence. This was due to insufficient evidence. The police are accused of providing biassed evidence to protect Akbaruddin, and the case is still being investigated by the High Court.\nOne would wonder why Barrister Owaisi did not bring up his acquittal in the midst of all of this. Maybe the resurfacing of an eleven-year-old grudge doesn't affect him too much.\n(With inputs from ANI)\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "Trump, Musk, NASA, and SpaceX: The fight over Sunita Williams\u2019 return",
        "WORLD\nPresident Donald Trump said he had personally asked Elon Musk for help in bringing astronauts back from the International Space Station. He also used the moment to criticize President Biden and his administration.\nGirish Linganna\nUpdated : Mar 08, 2025, 06:29 PM IST\nPresident Donald Trump said he had personally asked Elon Musk for help in bringing astronauts back from the International Space Station. He also used the moment to criticize President Biden and his administration.\nThe SpaceX Dragon spacecraft, which will bring astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore back to Earth, has been at the space station since September and was always supposed to bring them back home. Even so, Trump mentioned in the Oval Office on Thursday, March 6, that he had given Elon permission a week earlier to bring them back.\nTrump also said that former President Joe Biden felt embarrassed about the situation and decided to leave them there.\nThe astronauts earlier told CNN's Anderson Cooper that they don\u2019t feel \"stuck\" at the space station. However, NASA and the astronauts have struggled to completely dismiss this idea, partly because of the political back-and-forth involving Trump and Musk.\nWilmore reassured Cooper on February 13 that they don\u2019t feel abandoned, stuck, or stranded. He was responding to a question about Trump\u2019s remarks, as reported by USA Today.\nWhat\u2019s the latest with the Starliner?\nAstronauts Wilmore and Williams were chosen for the first crewed flight of the Starliner. In June 2024, they launched on a mission to test the Boeing Starliner, which is designed to eventually carry NASA astronauts to space alongside SpaceX\u2019s Dragon.\nBoth astronauts are highly experienced and are making their third trip to the space station.\nNASA found technical problems with the spacecraft, which delayed the astronauts' return home. In the end, the space agency had to bring the Starliner back to Earth in early September without its crew.\nThe SpaceX Dragon spacecraft, which will now bring astronauts Williams and Wilmore back to Earth, has been at the space station since late September. It originally arrived with the Crew-9 mission.\nAs part of NASA's plan, the spacecraft carried only two astronauts instead of the usual four. This left extra seats available for Williams and Wilmore on the trip back to Earth.\nThe Boeing\u00a0 Starliner crew members, Sunita Williams and Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore, joined the Crew-9 mission, whose astronauts are still completing their full stay in space.\nNASA announced in a mission update that the Dragon capsule, carrying the four astronauts of Crew-10, is set to launch as early as March 12. It will travel on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Kennedy Space Center in Florida, replacing the Crew-9 team.\nAs the name implies, this is the 10th crew rotation mission to the space station under NASA's commercial crew program.\nAstronaut Hague said in a news conference from space on Tuesday, March 4, that Crew-9 will pass the mission to Crew-10 before returning to Earth after a successful long stay.\nWhen the new astronauts reach the space station, there will be a few days of handover activities. After that, Williams and Wilmore will join Crew-9 in the SpaceX Dragon to leave the station, possibly around March 25.\nNASA astronaut Nick Hague will lead the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft as it returns to Earth, along with Mission Specialists Suni Williams, Butch Wilmore, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov. The crew practiced on Tuesday, 4th March using Dragon's computer tablets and reviewed the steps needed for the spacecraft to move away from the space station and reenter Earth's atmosphere before landing in the ocean near Florida. Hague and Gorbunov have been on the station since September 29, 2024, while Williams and Wilmore arrived on June 6.\n\n(The author Girish Linganna of this article is an award-winning Science Writer and a Defence, Aerospace & Political Analyst based in Bengaluru.

        "WORLD\nThe clashes began between government forces and supporters of former President Bashar Assad and later escalated into revenge killings\nShivam Verma\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 02:07 PM IST\nSyria has witnessed one of its deadliest incidents in recent years, with more than 1,000 people killed in just two days of violence. According to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the clashes began between government forces and supporters of former President Bashar Assad and later escalated into revenge killings.\nDeadly clashes and retaliation\nThe violence has claimed the lives of at least 745 civilians, including many who were killed at close range. Additionally, 125 government security personnel and 148 militants linked to Assad lost their lives. Large parts of Latakia province have been left without electricity and drinking water as a result of the fighting.\nThe conflict started on Thursday when security forces tried to arrest a wanted individual near Jableh. However, they were ambushed by Assad loyalists, leading to intense clashes, as reported by the Associated Press (AP).\nTargeting of Alawites\nOn Friday, the violence took a dangerous turn when Sunni Muslim gunmen, who support the government, began targeting Alawites, the minority sect to which Assad belongs. The attacks have created a significant challenge for Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the group that played a key role in removing Assad from power.\nResidents described horrifying scenes of brutality in Alawite villages. Ali Sheha, a 57-year-old from Baniyas, told AP, \u201cBodies were on the streets. The gunmen were less than 100 meters away, firing at homes and residents.\u201d He added that the attackers checked people\u2019s IDs to confirm their sect before killing them.\nInternational reactions\nThe Syrian government has claimed that it has regained control over most of the areas captured by Assad loyalists. Meanwhile, France has strongly condemned the violence. A statement from the French foreign ministry said, \u201cParis condemns in the strongest possible terms atrocities committed against civilians on religious grounds.\u201d\nThousands of Alawites have fled their homes, with many seeking shelter at Russia\u2019s Hmeimim airbase. Lebanese legislator Haidar Nasser urged the international community to protect Alawites, stating, \u201cThe international community should protect Alawites, who are Syrian citizens loyal to their country.\u201d\nAs tensions remain high, the situation in Syria continues to be fragile, with fears of further violence and instability.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

Several social media users have clarified the claim and urged people not to spread false rumours that can hamper the image of nation in front of the world.\u00a0\r\n\t\u00a0\r\n\tNot only Mortaza\u2019s home, but the residences of other Awami League members have also been demonstrated by the aggressiveness of the people. After the political discontent, particularly following the resignation of PM Sheikh Hasina's appointment, the riots escalated.\u00a0\r\n\t\u00a0\r\n\tFurther, there was a video clip of former captain Shakib Al Hasan, which initially appeared to support the current protestation. This video was, however, unrelated to the current affairs, but it went on to depict, how the population was misinformed during such unstable times.\n\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

The officer had said that while Holi is celebrated once a year, Friday prayers happen every week. He suggested that those uncomfortable with Holi colours should stay indoors.\nSpeaking at the India Today Conclave, Adityanath said the officer, though speaking in a straightforward manner, was correct. He thanked religious leaders for deciding to hold Friday prayers after 2 PM this year, as Holi falls on the same day. He also said that those who wish to pray earlier can do so at home.\nSambhal, which saw communal violence last year, has been in focus after the police officer\u2019s remark. The opposition Samajwadi Party has criticised the officer, calling him biased toward the ruling BJP.\nAt the event, Adityanath also addressed the recent Maha Kumbh stampede, where 30 pilgrims died on January 29. He denied claims that the government tried to hide the number of deaths. He said the administration\u2019s first priority was helping the injured and managing the large crowd. Once the situation was under control, the media was informed.\nThe Chief Minister also called the Maha Kumbh a symbol of unity and a lesson for those who questioned its significance.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

The DA was increased by the Cabinet from 46% of basic pay to 50% on March 7, 2024. On March 25, 2024, a few days before Holi, this announcement was made.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi will preside over a Cabinet meeting where a final decision will be made.\nMarch 14, 2025, is the date of the Holi celebration.\nEmployees of the central government received a 3% DA raise in October 2024, which went into effect on July 1st, 2024. Following the raise, the DA's share of basic pay went from 50% to 53%.\u00a0 The similar increase in dearness relief was given to pensioners as well.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

Meanwhile, reciprocal tariffs, expected to bring a significant shift in the US trade policies, is set to come in effect from April 2.\nThe US President also slammed countries like Canada for imposing 250 per cent tariffs on American dairy products, calling it \"unfair\".\n\"Canada has been ripping us off for years on tariffs for lumber and for dairy products. Two hundred and fifty percent. Nobody ever talks about that. Two hundred and fifty percent tariff, which is taking advantage of our farmers. So that's not going to happen anymore. We're going to be -- they'll be met with the exact same tariff unless they drop it,\" Trump said.\nNotably, the introduction of reciprocal tariffs is expected to have massive implications on the global trade relations, given other countries will have to reconsider their tariff policies.\nWith inputs from ANI.\n\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

However, the research finds that this video was altered and circulated to spread false information.\nThe video caused controversy when it was uploaded on social media by several accounts, including official Congress accounts. The accounts claimed that the doctored tape showed the BJP's 'agenda to abolish SC/ST reservation quotas.' BJP officials have taken issue with these statements, accusing the Congress of spreading misleading information that could cause societal unrest.\nAmid Lok Sabha elections 2024, ZEE News anchor Sourabh Raaj Jain analyzed the threats that technology poses to the nation's democracy in the digital era\nAmit Shah, the Home Minister, is allegedly heard saying in a video released on the social networking site X on April 28 at 6:42 am that the 'unconstitutional reservation' for SC, ST, and OBC will be eliminated if the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) wins power. The user added, \"We will end SC-ST and OBC reservation: Home Minister Amit Shah,\" to the post. On social media, this video has rapidly garnered popularity and generated conversation.\nThe Delhi Police on Sunday registered a case over a doctored video circulating on social media platforms. The video, which has sparked controversy and allegations of misinformation, has prompted the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) to file a complaint seeking action against those responsible for it.\nPM Modi on Monday also targeted political rivals for circulating a tampered video of Union Home Minister Amit Shah. PM Modi said addressing an election rally in Maharashtra's Satara that it's due to the fear of losing the elections that the opposition is spreading fake news.

        "WORLD\nThe massive deposit, located beneath the soil of Folswiller in the Moselle region, is estimated to hold 46 million tonnes of hydrogen\nShivam Verma\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 09:01 AM IST\nFrance has made a big discovery in green energy with the largest known natural hydrogen reserve on the planet. The massive deposit, located beneath the soil of Folswiller in the Moselle region, is estimated to hold 46 million tonnes of hydrogen. According to reports, the value of this reserve is around $92 trillion, with expectations that its worth will rise in the future.\nThis discovery, made by researchers from the Georesources Laboratory and CNRS, was unexpected.\nScientists were originally searching for methane but instead found an enormous supply of white hydrogen buried 1,250 meters underground. This form of hydrogen is a potential game-changer as it provides a clean energy source without carbon emissions.\nUnlike green hydrogen, which requires electricity from renewable sources for production, or grey hydrogen, which is derived from fossil fuels and contributes to pollution, white hydrogen is naturally occurring. It is found deep underground and does not require complex industrial processes or generate harmful emissions.\nCurrently, the world\u2019s hydrogen economy faces challenges due to high production costs and dependency on fossil fuels. White hydrogen presents a cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative. If similar reserves are found elsewhere, it could spark a global shift toward sustainable energy.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "ANALYSIS\nInterestingly, Sriram Krishnan has spoken in favour of expanding the H1B program and expediting the green card for individuals belonging to certain professions. He has also been in favour of removing the country cap on H1-B visas and Green cards.\nTridivesh Singh Maini\nUpdated : Dec 26, 2024, 04:56 PM IST\nIncoming US President Donald Trump recently appointed Sriram Krishnan as his Senior Advisor on Artificial Intelligence. Chennai born techie Sriram Krishnan has vast experience and has been a general partner of the American venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz since 2021. He began his career with Microsoft, after which he joined Facebook. Till 2019, Sriram Krishnan worked for Twitter (now X) and closely worked with Elon Musk who will be co-heading DOGE (Department for Government efficiency)\nWhile announcing his appointment, Trump in a post on X said:\n\u201cSriram Krishnan will serve as Senior Policy Advisor for Artificial Intelligence at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy\u2026Sriram will focus on ensuring continued American leadership in A.I., and help shape and coordinate A.I. policy across Government, including working with the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology\u201d\nIn his post, Trump also mentioned Krishnan\u2019s rich experience and the fact that he began his career with Microsoft.\nInterestingly, Sriram Krishnan has spoken in favour of expanding the H1B program and expediting the green card for individuals belonging to certain professions. He has also been in favour of removing the country cap on H1-B visas and Green cards.\nSeveral Trump supporters were critical of his appointment pointing to his stance on H1B and Green cards. Far-right American activist Laura Loomer said that Sriram Krishnan\u2019s views on immigration are diametrically opposite to those of Trump and go against the \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda of Donald Trump. She also dubbed the Indian origin entrepreneur as a \u201ccareer leftist\u201d.\nDavid Sacks, Incoming White House A.I. & Crypto Czar\u00a0 and Elon Musk came to Sriram Krishan\u2019s defense.\nSacks highlighted the point that Sriram Krishnan does not want to remove all caps, but country-based ones. Said Sacks\n\u201cSriram still supports skills-based criteria for receiving a green card, not making the program unlimited. He wants to make the program entirely merit-based\u201d..\nElon Musk also said that the criticism of Sriram Krishnan lacked merit and was based on the \u2018fixed-pie\u2019 fallacy. Said Musk in a post on X:\n\u201cThe \u2018fixed pie\u2019 fallacy is at the heart of much wrong-headed economic thinking. There is essentially infinite potential for job and company creation. Think of all the things that didn\u2019t exist 20 or 30 years ago!\u201d\nThe appointment of Sriram Krishnan points to the possible divide within the upcoming Trump administration regarding immigration policies.\nIt is not just Sriram Krishnan, even Elon Musk himself has repeatedly highlighted the fact that the US should be open to welcoming talented individuals who contribute towards the country\u2019s economy.\nHere it would be pertinent to point out that Trump himself has spoken about the need for US to welcome and retain talent. During an interview, the incoming president had said that international students who graduate from US colleges should be granted Green cards. It remains to be seen if Trump actually implements this proposal.\nIn conclusion, it remains to be seen if Trump and his team go ahead with some of the tough policy reforms pertaining to immigration while also focusing on retaining international students with skills and qualifications. There could be divisions in the upcoming administration on the issue of immigration. Certain members of his team would not be opposed to an immigration policy which is merit-based, while others may favour an approach which is driven more by political interests and aimed at appealing to certain constituencies. While course-corrections in the realm of immigration policies are taking place across the Anglosphere \u2013 UK, Canada and Australia \u2013 some changes under Trump 2.0 can not be ruled out. At the same time an excessively insular immigration policy which discourages students and professionals would be counter productive for the US.\n(Disclaimer: The views expressed above are the author's own and do not reflect those of DNA.)\n\r\n\tThe author is a policy analyst and faculty member at the Jindal School of International Affairs, OP Jindal Global University, Sonipat.\n\n\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "WORLD\nHe also said that a meeting took place between the diplomatic teams of the UK and Ukraine to discuss steps to achieve peace\nShivam Verma\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 06:45 AM IST\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy shared on Saturday details of the upcoming meeting between American and Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia for negotiating peace talks as the Russia-Ukraine conflict continues to rage on. He also said that a meeting took place between the diplomatic teams of the UK and Ukraine to discuss steps to achieve peace.\nIn a post on X, Zelenskyy said, \"Today, a highly productive meeting took place in Kyiv between the diplomatic teams of Ukraine and the UK. We discussed our joint steps that could bring us closer to peace and accelerate diplomatic efforts. I'm grateful for the support. Ukraine is determined to do everything to end this war with a just and lasting peace as soon as possible.\"\nEarlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed strong appreciation for the support Ukraine has received during a European leaders summit in London on March 2, focused on Ukraine's future and its relationship with Europe.\nDuring his recent visit to the UK, Zelenskyy and UK PM Keir Starmer discussed the challenges facing Ukraine and Europe, and efforts to achieve a just peace with strong security guarantees.\nEarlier this year, the UK and Ukraine signed a 100-year partnership agreement, which had given a call for Ukraine's recovery and committed towards fostering technological innovation along with focus on several other areas.\nThe Ukrainian President further said that next week, he will visit Saudi Arabia, where he will hold a meeting with the Crown Prince, followed by a meeting with the American team.\n\"Next week, I will begin with a visit to Saudi Arabia. After my meeting on Monday with the Crown Prince, Ukrainian diplomatic and military representatives will stay for a meeting on Tuesday with the American team. The Ukrainian team will include Andriy Yermak, Andriy Sybiha, Rustem Umerov, and Pavlo Palisa,\" he stated in his post.\n\"On our side, we are fully committed to constructive dialogue, and we hope to discuss and agree on the necessary decisions and steps. Ukraine has been seeking peace from the very first second of this war. Realistic proposals are on the table. The key is to move quickly and effectively,\" Zelenskyy added.\nMeanwhile, US envoy Steve Witkoff confirmed he would meet Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia, and would discuss an \"initial ceasefire\" and a \"framework\" for a longer agreement, as reported by Al Jazeera.\nNotably, Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the talks would take place in Jeddah.\nAl Jazeera reported that this will be the first high-level gathering of US and Ukrainian officials since the February 28 meeting between Zelenskyy and Trump.\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by DNA staff and is published from ANI)\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "INDIA\nFollowing US President Donald Trump's announcement on reciprocal tariffs, the opposition Congress has trained guns at the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led centre, asking \"what compromises were made to please the newly elected president of the US\".\nMeemansa Shekhawat\nUpdated : Mar 08, 2025, 11:54 AM IST\nFollowing US President Donald Trump's announcement on reciprocal tariffs, the opposition Congress has trained guns at the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led centre, asking \"what compromises were made to please the newly elected president of the US\".\nDonald Trump, speaking from the White House, claimed that India has agreed to cut high tariffs because \"someone exposed them for what thay have done\". \"India charges us massive tariffs. Massive. You can't even sell anything in India...They have agreed, by the way; they want to cut their tariffs way down now because somebody is finally exposing them for what they have done\", said Trump, as quoted by news agency ANI.\nMeanwhile, the grand-old-party attacked the central government, stating that it is an insult to India. In a post on 'X', the Congress wrote, \"The US President says that he is exposing India. This is an insult to India. Trump also said that Narendra Modi reduced the tariffs because of his fear\".\n\nMarch 8, 2025\n\n\"Narendra Modi should tell what compromises were made to please Trump? Why was the nation's honour mortgaged? This is a very serious matter. The Modi government should give an answer to the country on this.Along with this, an all-party meeting should be called to discuss all the issues related to this so that it can be ensured that national interest is paramount\", it added.\nDonald Trump-led US administration has been vocal about high tariffs imposed on American goods. The US government plans to impose reciprocal tariffs on countries that charge high levies on American goods.\nThe US president, previously, stated that the US will not tolerate \"being taken advantage of\" by such countries. Reciprocal tariffs, expected to mark a significant shift in the America's trade policies, will be implemented on April 2.\n\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "WORLD\nAs per Al Jazeera, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Macron's speech in which he called Russia a threat to France and Europe was \"extremely confrontational\".\nSrishty Choudhury\nUpdated : Mar 07, 2025, 04:23 PM IST\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday said Russian aggression \"knows no borders\" and is a direct threat to Europe as European Union leaders prepare to hold emergency talks in Brussels in the wake of the Trump administration's stance on transatlantic ties, Al Jazeera reported.\u00a0\"Who can believe that this Russia of today will stop at Ukraine?\" Macron said in a televised address late on Wednesday, as per Al Jazeera.\n\r\n\tIn a post on X, Macron said, \"Our generation will no longer receive the peace dividend. It is up to us to ensure that our children reap the dividends of our commitments tomorrow. So we will face it, together.\"\n\r\n\tMacron warned that Europe must be prepared to stand alone in the face of Russian aggression. \"I want to believe the US will stay by our side,\" said Macron. \"But we have to be ready if that isn't the case.\"\n\r\n\t\"The future of Europe does not have to be decided in Washington or Moscow,\" he added.\nMacron added that he plans next week to hold a meeting of army chiefs from European countries willing to send troops to Ukraine after any eventual peace deal with Russia, as per Al Jazeera.\nMacron also said he would discuss with his European partners extending French nuclear deterrence to other countries on the continent, but that the decision and control would continue to remain in the French president's hands.\n\"France will follow only one course: that of the will for peace and freedom, faithful to its history and its principles. The homeland needs you and your commitment,\" Macron said in a post on X.\nAs per Al Jazeera, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Macron's speech in which he called Russia a threat to France and Europe was \"extremely confrontational\".\nThe speech indicates that France is thinking about \"continuing the war\". Macron did not say anything about NATO's expansion towards Russia's borders, as per Kremlin.\n\r\n\t\"One can conclude that France thinks more about war, about continuing the war,\" said Peskov.\nThe conflict is a \"proxy war between nuclear powers\" - the US helping Ukraine and Russia - and it needs to come to an end, Al Jazeera quoted the Kremlin as saying.\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by DNA staff and is published from ANI)\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "WORLD\nKenny Holston of The New York Times via AP, Pool, quotes Trump as saying that his \u201cproudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier,\u201d as he continues his inaugural address.\nGirish Linganna\nUpdated : Jan 21, 2025, 01:13 PM IST\nDonald John Trump was sworn in as the 47th president of the United States on Monday. Soon after taking the oath as president, he said he was returning as the 47th president \u201cconfident and optimistic\u201d and that \u201ca thrilling new era of national success\u201d had begun. \u201cA tide of change is sweeping the country. Sunlight is pouring over the entire world, and America has the chance to seize this opportunity like never before.\u201d\n\u2018The rest of the world will envy us\u2019Trump vowed at his inaugural Address that he would end weaponization of the Justice Department and stated, \u201cThe scales of justice will be rebalanced. The vicious, violent and unfair weaponization of the Justice Department and government will end.\u201d\n\u2018I assure every American that I will always put \u2018America First\u2019, said Trump. \u201cThere will be sweeping changes, starting with the vicious weaponization of the Justice Department. From this moment on, America\u2019s decline globally is over\u2019.\nKenny Holston of The New York Times via AP, Pool, quotes Trump as saying that his \u201cproudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier,\u201d as he continues his inaugural address.\nHe said, \u201cLike in 2017, we will again build the strongest military the world has ever seen. We will measure our success not only by the battles we win, but also by the wars that we end. And, perhaps, most importantly, the wars we never get into.\u201d\nBut, making his first major announcement, the newly elected President of the United States (POTUS) declared a state of emergency on the southern border of Mexico, which received a standing ovation from all Republicans and a few swing-state Democrats, including Reps\u2014never mind 1960s singer Joan Baez\u2019s \u2018Jailhouse Trilogy\u2019\u2026\u201cLuna was a Mexican, the law called an alien,/ He came across the border with a baby and a wife\u2026\u201d. Trump, incidentally, announced that he would deport \u201cmillions and millions of criminal aliens\u201d.\nTrump wants to deport millions of people who live illegally in the US. However, he had already warned Mexico and other countries\u2014even Canada!\u2014of high tariffs and other penalties if they did not stop illegal immigrants from crossing the border.\nWhat Are Big Executive Orders?\nTrump is poised to pass several executive orders and directives on Day One in his second term as president related to matters ranging from energy to immigration, including declaring a national emergency at the US-Mexico border\u2014tackling such issues as immigration, energy, trade and social policies. Moreover, more than 200 additional directives are coming in the next few days. The orders are in tune with Trump\u2019s main campaign promises, including starting mass deportations and putting a lid on border security.\n\u201cI\u2019m pleased to say that, as of yesterday, one day before I assumed office, the hostages in the Middle East are coming back home to their families,\u201d Trump added to a standing ovation from those present. Israel\u2019s security Cabinet has approved a US-backed ceasefire deal with Hamas, which includes the release of hostages. The deal was delayed due to disputes with Hamas, but now it is moving forward\nThe Hamas-Israel ceasefire deal was mediated by Qatar and the US on Wednesday. However, Netanyahu said there were last-minute snags. But, in a significant move towards ending the 15-month-long war in Gaza, Israel\u2019s government, on Saturday, approved the ceasefire agreement with Hamas (effect on Sunday, January 19, including a series of hostage exchanges)\nGulf of Mexico Is Now \u2018Gulf of America\u2019\nTrump announced that he would rename the \u2018Gulf of Mexico\u2019 as the \u2018Gulf of America\u2019\nDefining National Energy Emergency\nOn the energy front, Trump plans to declare a national energy emergency with the will to promote \u2018affordable and reliable American energy\u2019. His campaign promise, \u2018Drill, Baby, drill\u2019, speaks a lot of this for hiking domestic energy production\nThe Issue of Energy Development in Alaska\nTrump will issue an EO making energy development in Alaska a top priority, emphasising the state\u2019s strategic importance to national security and its potential to become a key hub for LNG exports\nAdditionally, reports suggest Trump may withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement once again and take aim at policies supporting electric vehicles\nThe Issue of Trade and Tariffs\nMore actions may be imposing tariffs on global battery materials, rolling back environmental regulations and revoking California\u2019s stricter emissions standards. Trump has his trade agenda planned out\u2014clear and direct\u2014with his US agencies reviewing trade relationships with such countries as China, Canada and Mexico. The US has planned immediate new tariffs, but the review could lead to significant changes\nTrump has proposed tariffs of 10% on global imports\u2014that is 60% on Chinese goods and 25% on Canadian and Mexican products\u2014arguing these measures could spur US economic growth. Critics, however, warn that such moves may increase consumer costs\nViews On Transgengender Rights\nAs part of a series of executive orders, Trump plans to issue an order defining only two genders strictly as male and female, effectively ending policies that recognize transgender identities in federal government practices. Trump also intends to ban transgender individuals from serving in the military, being recognized in US schools and participating in women\u2019s sports\nPardons That Trump Expects to Give\nTrump plans to \u2018pardon\u2019 people who have been charged, or even convicted, for being involved in the Capitol attack on January 6, 2021\u2014a violent attack in which an unruly mob barged into the lawns of the Capitol to disrupt Congress\u2019s validation of the 2020 poll results. Trump wowed the crowd with so-called \u2018baseless\u2019 remarks of poll fraud at a rally earlier that day. However, he denied any responsibility for the violence that ensued.\nBy focusing on these sweeping changes across key policy areas, Trump\u2019s Administration aims to rapidly implement its agenda from Day One.\nAnd These Were Trump\u2019s Last Words\nAnd Trump\u2019s last words were that he wanted to send US astronauts to Mars. \u201c(We) will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars and plant the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars\u201d, he added.\n(The author of this article is an award-winning Science Writer and a Defence, Aerospace & Political Analyst based in Bengaluru.

Our relationship has been a very good one,\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social, a social media platform he owns.\nHowever, ties with the US\u2019 other neighbour, Canada, remained troubled as Trump accused Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of using the ongoing tariffs dispute to stay in power. Trudeau had announced his resignation in January and is expected to step down after a replacement is chosen by his party.\n\u201cOur goal remains to get these tariffs, all tariffs removed,\u201d the Canadian PM said in a statement.\nEarlier this week, the US\u2019 25% tariffs on both the neighbours had kicked in, sending global markets into turmoil.\nBesides Mexico and Canada, Trump has also imposed sweeping tariffs on China, hinting that trade taxes would be a key aspect of his foreign policy. Trump says the tariffs will boost US production, protect domestic jobs, and grow the American economy.\r\n\tHe had earlier said the import taxes were a way to stop illegal immigration and trafficking of the deadly drug fentanyl.\nMore recently, Trump has indicated plans to impose \u201creciprocal tariffs\u201d \u2013 tailored to each trading partner of the US \u2013 to tackle trade practices considered unfair by Washington.\nHowever, many economists warn that tariffs could lead to price rises for customers in the US while triggering severe economic crises in Mexico and Canada.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "What is D-Remit in National Pension System?",
        "D-Remit, a crucial feature in the National Pension System (NPS), \u00a0allows subscribers to transfer funds from one NPS account to another seamlessly. This facility helps in simplifying the process for subscribers who wish to move their accumulated funds between different pension accounts. D-Remit is primarily designed for those who switch jobs, change locations, or opt for a different pension fund manager.\nSimplifying Fund Transfers for Subscribers\nD-Remit enables subscribers to seamlessly transfer their accumulated NPS funds without any disruptions. This eliminates the need for the traditional, cumbersome process that once required manual paperwork and involved multiple steps. The feature is intended to ensure continuity in retirement savings, which is crucial for individuals who frequently change jobs or relocate across the country.\nBenefits of D-Remit\nHow D-Remit Works\nUnder D-Remit, subscribers can request a transfer of funds from one NPS account to another through their current NPS account holder or the new account manager. This system reduces the complications involved in manual transfer requests and offers a more streamlined process. Subscribers simply need to initiate the transfer from their online account, making the process far more accessible and convenient.\nRole in NPS Growth and Accessibility\nD-Remit is seen as an important step towards increasing the flexibility and reach of NPS, especially for those working in the private sector or frequently moving across different geographical locations. By simplifying the transfer process, it encourages individuals to invest in NPS with more confidence, knowing that their retirement savings will not be hindered due to job or location changes.\nIn recent years, the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA)\u00a0has been working on several initiatives to make NPS more accessible, with D-Remit being one of the key steps in improving subscriber experience. The system is expected to make it easier for new and existing subscribers to stay enrolled in NPS, improving overall participation in the scheme."

        "Modi goes on Gir safari, spotlights Asiatic lion revival, and renews wildlife conservation pledge",
        "Prime Minister Narendra Modi took a lion safari at Gir Wildlife Sanctuary on World Wildlife Day, highlighting India's efforts to protect Asiatic lions and promote biodiversity conservation.\nModi Starts Safari: Prime Minister Narendra Modi kicked off a lion safari at Gir Wildlife Sanctuary in Gujarat on March 3, 2025, aligning with World Wildlife Day. His visit to the state included this special outing to spotlight conservation efforts. He started early Monday morning, driving through the sanctuary to observe its wildlife.\nSafari Location Details: The safari took place at Gir Wildlife Sanctuary, situated in Gujarat\u2019s Junagadh district, a region famous for its Asiatic lions. This sanctuary serves as a critical habitat for these animals, and Modi\u2019s visit aimed to raise awareness about their preservation.\nOfficials Join Tour: Modi was joined by several ministers and senior forest department officials during the jeep safari at Gir Wildlife Sanctuary. They travelled together through the rugged terrain, observing the lions in their natural environment. Modi took photographs of the animals, capturing their movements and surroundings.\nCommitment to Biodiversity: On World Wildlife Day, Modi renewed his promise to protect the planet\u2019s biodiversity, sharing his thoughts via a post on X. He wrote, \"Today, on #WorldWildlifeDay, let's reiterate our commitment to protect and preserve the incredible biodiversity of our planet.\" He also attached a video showcasing his previous jungle safaris.\nFocus on Species Role: Modi stressed the importance of every species in sustaining ecological balance, a point he made clear in his X post.

        "Podcast Host\u2019s Rant About North Indian Tourists In Vietnam Has The Internet Screaming \u2018Stereotype Alert\u2019",
        "A podcast host has stirred the pot on social media after sharing his less-than-pleasant encounters with North Indian tourists during his New Year trip to Vietnam.\nRavi Handa, the host of Desi FIRE Podcast, accused them of \u201cruining\u201d his travel experience, sparking a flurry of reactions online.\nRavi Handa kicked off the conversation by explaining why he skipped Goa for his New Year\u2019s getaway. \u201cGoa has too many North Indian tourists, and they ruin the experience,\u201d he said, choosing Vietnam instead. But to his dismay, he encountered what he described as \u201cbad behaviour\u201d from Indian tourists there as well.\nI went to Vietnam for the new year break, and Goa was a choice. But not for the reasons any of you people on twitter go bonkers about. Goa has too many North Indian tourists and they ruin the experience. Even in Vietnam, the only bad behavior was from North Indian tourists.\u2026 https://t.co/CHiZeVRgoT\nFrom cutting lines with excuses like \u201cHum logon ke pass special pass hai\u201d to shouting Bharat Mata Ki Jai in a crowded train, Handa claimed the loud antics were mostly from North Indians. \u201cI even stopped one at the cable car line,\u201d he added, \u201cbut arguing seemed pointless.\u201d\nNaturally, Twitter took sides faster than a tea-seller at an Indo-Pak match. Many users lashed out at Handa for stereotyping North Indians, calling his remarks \u201cracist.\u201d\n\u201cHow did you know they were North Indians?\u201d asked one user, to which Handa replied that the tourists explicitly mentioned being from NCR. Another user pointed out, \u201cThis mentality of dividing North, South, East, and West is why we can\u2019t progress as a society.\u201d\nUber racist comment \ud83e\udd2eHow did you know that misbehaving tourists were North India?You can tell everything about a person by looking at him \ud83e\udd2d\nWhile Handa\u2019s comments did raise eyebrows, they also found some support. Many North Indians chimed in, admitting they\u2019ve witnessed similar behaviour. \u201cMe, being a North Indian myself, always felt ashamed, but now it\u2019s a whole new level of shame!\u201d wrote one user.\nYep. We have to agree that we Indians don't have civics sense (including me). We need to improve. And more people coming out on SM is one such way to nudge us to improve.\nAnother added, \u201cThere was a group of North Indians on a train in Europe, making too much noise in the name of \u2018having a good time.\u2019 All the other Europeans were silent, and only these people were shouting.\u201d\nThe debate has reignited conversations about travel etiquette and the stereotypes associated with Indian tourists abroad. While some argue that bad behaviour knows no region, others believe it\u2019s time to introspect and, well, turn the volume down a notch.\nSo, what do you think? Are these stereotypes justified, or are we simply dividing ourselves further? Let us know in the comments, but, you know, quietly."

        "People Share Toxic Things In Desi Culture That Are Normalized & There\u2019s So Much We Are Doing Wrong",
        "There\u2019s always a lot to love about places that we come from, they\u2019re home after all. This means that even our culture is something that we deeply love, despite the flaws; and there\u2019s no denying that there are a lot of flaws. So much of the desi culture boils down to pretending that we are better than the rest, it\u2019s as if we are constantly competing. A lot of our ideas and opinions are problematic in ways that they harm all of us. Yet, we don\u2019t let them go.\nSome people shared similar instances and ideas of our culture that are deeply toxic:\n1. \u201cThe idea that we have to respect people who are older than us \u2013 relatives and family members, solely because they\u2019re older in age. When in fact, the basis for respect should be an individual\u2019s personality \u2013 it should depend on how they are as human beings.\u201d\n\u2013 Anonymous\n2. \u201cYou cannot have a male friend without the family assuming that you\u2019re in a relationship. This is especially true for women, their friendships with men are ruined because of this regressive mindset.\n\u2013 Aaliyah Jain\n3. \u201cPeople think that there\u2019s a specific age bar to get married. So, anytime you reach anywhere nearer that age, relatives and family members start pestering you. This is pressuring and wrong.\u201d\n\u2013 Naman Issar\n4. \u201cSo many parents make it a point to show that they\u2019re doing a favour when they\u2019re there for the children. Most things they do, they do it as an obligation. The mentality that raising a child is a favour is so toxic \u2013 it\u2019s a choice. Children should not be shown that they owe their parents something because they chose to raise a child.\u201d\n\u2013 Manya\n5. \u201cOur society spends too much money on weddings. This is mostly done to show off \u2013 and it\u2019s problematic. In some cases, people start saving money for the women\u2019s wedding when they\u2019re kids. All of this for someone else, when this money could actually be used for the kids\u2019 future or as an investment.\n\u2013 Izhan Saifi\n6. \u201cGossiping is neither normal, nor okay. I don\u2019t understand why desi culture has normalized it.\u201d\n\u2013 Shantanu Ghosh\n7. \u201cThe idea that parents\u2019 love is unconditional, is flawed. They say that they\u2019ll love us for who we are, despite everything. However, it mostly comes down to their terms. They love us when we live on their terms, when we make them happy by doing things they like. They don\u2019t love us for who we are.\u201d\n\u2013 Anonymous\n8. \u201cWe can hardly take other people doing well. Everything is a competition with us, and we only feel like we are successful when other people around us aren\u2019t doing better than us. I\u2019ve hardly seen people being genuinely happy for someone else\u2019s success. This competition is ingrained in our mentality.\u201d\n\u2013 Riya Gill\n9. \u201cWe\u2019re so into pleasing others, and looking a certain way that we don\u2019t even leave situations like a death of someone close. Our rituals and the idea of having to serve \u201cgood food\u201d are deeply toxic.\u201d\n\u2013 Harshit Ailawadi\n\n10. \u201cYou\u2019re expected to follow the guidance of your elder siblings out of respect. However, sometimes that can end up having an adverse affect, especially if the siblings are either narcissistic or abusive.\u201d\n\u2013 Harshita Singh\nA lot to think about, and correct."

However, progress continues as more women break barriers, challenge stereotypes, and inspire the next generation to pursue careers in science and technology.\nHere are some few exmaples of Indian women who are redefining STEM leadership\nKalpana Chawla, the first woman of Indian origin in space, inspired millions with her journey as a NASA astronaut. Dr. Tessy Thomas, known as the \u201cMissile Woman of India,\" played a crucial role in the development of India\u2019s Agni missile program. Dr. Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, a pioneer in biotechnology, founded Biocon and revolutionized affordable healthcare solutions. Dr. Gagandeep Kang, a leading virologist, has been instrumental in vaccine development and public health research in India. Dr. Ritu Karidhal and Muthayya Vanitha, key scientists behind India\u2019s Chandrayaan and Mangalyaan missions, showcase India\u2019s excellence in space exploration.\nInternational Women\u2019s Day 2025 is a celebration of progress, resilience, and the limitless potential of women everywhere. As we honor these trailblazers, we look ahead to a future where gender equality in STEM\u2014and beyond\u2014is fully realised.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

But do you know the story behind the remarkable success of the e-commerce platform?\nMeemansa Shekhawat\nUpdated : Mar 06, 2025, 04:19 PM IST\nWith today's fast-paced world dominated by e-commerce platforms, Meesho is a name that has reached almost every household, emerging as a revolutionary force. But do you know the story behind the remarkable success of the e-commerce platform?\nWell, let us tell you that it was founded by two IITians - Vidit Aatrey and Sanjeev Barnwal. Let's delve into their journey.\nJourney of Meesho founders\nVidit Aatrey and Sanjeev Barnwal were classmates at IIT, Delhi. After graduating from IIT, Barnwal moved to Japan where he joined Sony's Core Tech team. Despite having a high-paying job, he still had an aspiration to start something of his own.\nLater, he connected to his friend, Vidit Aatrey, who was then working at\u00a0Bangalore-based InMobi firm. The duo left their respective jobs in 2015. While they were contemplating a startup idea, they envisioned a marketplace with the goal to develop a platform that could prioritise a business's success.\nIn late 2015, Meesho began operations at a small two-bedroom flat in Karnataka. Interestingly, their first workstation was a dining table in the apartment.\nBirth of Meesho\nVidit Aatrey and Sanjeev Barnwal came up with a simple idea - to enable anyone to start their own business online. Their experience at IIT Delhi and in the corporate world helped them discover that while giant e-commerce platforms were flourishing, there still was a need for an accessible platform where small businesses and individuals could sell their products.\nAnd rest is history! Meesho was then founded with the approach to provide an accessible platform, connecting suppliers\u00a0manufacturers, and end consumers via social media channels such as Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and more.\nRise of Meesho\nMeesho stands for - Meri Shop (Apni Dukaan). In April 2021, its valuation reached 2.1 billion dollars. Moreover, by September 2021, it reached nearly 4.9 billion dollars, signalling that its success was merely the beginning.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "VIRAL\nThe call bridged two major cities\u2014Kolkata and New Delhi\u2014marking the beginning of mobile communication in India\nShivam Verma\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 12:13 PM IST\nOn July 31, 1995, India entered a new era of communication when the first-ever mobile phone call was made in the country. This historic call connected then West Bengal Chief Minister Jyoti Basu with Union Communication Minister Sukh Ram. It was made using a Nokia handset on the Modi Telstra network, a joint venture between India\u2019s BK Modi and Australia\u2019s Telstra.\nThe call bridged two major cities\u2014Kolkata and New Delhi\u2014marking the beginning of mobile communication in India. However, at that time, mobile phones were a luxury. Making a call cost Rs 8.4 per minute, and both incoming and outgoing calls were charged. During peak hours, the cost doubled to Rs 16.8 per minute, making it affordable only for a few.\nOver the years, mobile communication in India has transformed drastically. High call rates are now a thing of the past, thanks to technological advancements and competition. A major breakthrough came in 2016 when Jio launched affordable data plans, revolutionising the telecom industry.\nToday, mobile phones are an essential part of everyday life. Calls, messages, and internet access are available at low costs, making communication faster and easier for everyone.\nFrom that first call in 1995 to today\u2019s seamless connectivity, India\u2019s telecom journey is a story of growth, innovation, and accessibility.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "DNA Exclusive: India's first Twitter user on her 16-year Twitter journey and Elon Musk's\u00a0'adventures'",
        "TECHNOLOGY\nNaina spoke at length on her 16-year journey on the platform, and how she sees the major revamp that Musk tends to bring to the social media giant.\nVidisha Chopra\nUpdated : Nov 13, 2022, 10:18 AM IST\nOn October 28, 2022, Elon Musk acquired an unprofitable company at USD 44 million, and it now seems that he is making every desperate attempt to coup his losses. His plan of action not only included massive layoffs and harsh diktat for employees (12 hours a day shift, no rest day), but also an intent to make the \u2018highly coveted\u2019 blue tick payable at USD 8 per month (approx. Rs 650 per month).\nWhile the second move seems to have been scrubbed in wake of the storm of fake handles getting the \u2018Verified\u2019 badge, industry experts believe that Musk\u2019s \u2018stunts\u2019 might leave the social media giant in the lurch.\nAccording to Statista, Twitter has about 23.6 million users (as of January 2022) in India. However, India reportedly accounts only for a small percentage of Twitter\u2019s revenue. The registered entity of Twitter in India recorded Rs 86.39 crore as revenue in FY21. But this was just 0.23 percent of the global revenue. In FY22, though its revenue jumped by about 82 percent, to Rs 156.75 crore, the India entity posted a net loss of Rs 31.84 crore for FY22.\nAmid all the chaos around Twitter and its owner Musk making headlines almost every day, we thought of discussing this fiasco with someone who has been long associated with Twitter and got the opportunity to have a detailed discussion with Naina Redhu, arguably the first Twitter user in India. Naina spoke at length on her 16-year journey on Twitter and how she sees the major revamp that Elon Musk tends to bring to the social media platform.\nHere are the edited excerpts of the interview:\nSince when have you been on the platform? How did you end up signing onto the platform?\nI signed up to the platform in 2006, back when it was called TWTTR. I had a job in Mumbai and I was very interested in the way the internet was coming up and blogging was a thing, at least abroad, not in India. I started my first blog in 2004 so I was quite involved with the things that were happening online.\u00a0\r\n\t\u00a0\nHow was your experience back then?\nBack then, I think I remember very clearly that I signed on and I was very curious to know what was happening. I saw that there were a few people who were writing texts on the screen and they were talking as if they already knew each other. I noticed that all of them were located in Palo Alto, California and they were all planning to meet up for a coffee or a pizza. And I was just hoping that there was somebody in Bombay that I could say that to. But there was no one else. I thought that maybe the platform is only for the US audience and it wasn\u2019t meant for someone in India.\nIs that how you figured out that you were the first Twitter user?\nSomeone told me that \u2018I think you might be the first twitter user from India.\u2019 They then pointed me to an article that said \u2018The first 140 people to sign up to Twitter\u2019 and when I checked it out I couldn\u2019t find a single Indian or an India-sounding name on that list. I thought that this could be true. I then wrote an article on my blog \u2018Am I the first Indian Twitter user?\u2019 A lot of people responded by saying that they cannot find any other Indian user. No one really dug deep but its commonly thought that I am the first Twitter user from India.\nWhat have been the drastic changes that you have noticed from 2006 to 2022?\nOne was of course the character limit change. From 140 to 280 characters which I think took away the essence of Twitter because with 140 characters, what I used to do was try really hard to compress what I was talking about in 140 characters. But with the 280 characters and the whole \u2018thread-system\u2019, it has become like a blog.\nOne thing that I miss is the \u2018Fail Whale\u2019 where a blue color whale popped up when the platform would crash because, maybe, they could not keep up with the demand of the users all over the world. The \u2018Fail Whale\u2019 has gone which is great for Twitter and the services that they provide but I miss it because once in a while, we would go like \u2018Oh yeah, even I saw a Fail Whale. Did you see it?\u2019\nBut the community aspect of Twitter has been lost. And I haven't seen it coming back. I remember going for \u2018Tweet-Ups\u2019 for everyone who is on Twitter who would've met or chatted, we would go to a restaurant, meet them, chat, have food and actually get to know the person in real life. I don\u2019t think anyone would ever do that, on Twitter at least. The platform was a lot more of learning, talking to new people, learning about new things etc.\nThe platform has become a lot more politics, and a lot more controversial topics are talked about which is not really a bad thing but I do feel that the personal touch in the smaller community aspect has definitely gone which I miss.\nAfter Elon musk\u2019s takeover, there have been a bunch of changes on the platform. The company was recently planning to impose subscription fee for the verification badge. Do you think people would be willing to pay for the blue tick?\nI don\u2019t have clarity over it yet because I saw that screenshots were shared with 2 badges. One was the blue tick and the other was the \u2018Official\u2019 tag. I think they are still trying to decide what to do with the blue tick because the verification sign has always been there to determine or to verify that this is the real person in real life who is also on Twitter. They are trying to change that but I am not sure what it will mean, yet.\nThe USD 8 dollars initially was for Twitter Blue subscription where you could see lesser ads and there were a bunch of other features. But why would I pay money to see lesser ads? If taking money, then say no ads. Although I don\u2019t use Twitter as much anymore.\nElon Musk had tweeted that they are experimenting different things on the platform and they will see what works and what doesn\u2019t. Was it the same earlier?\nThat\u2019s what I loved about twitter. That\u2019s what it used to be. In the early days when it had started picking up, there was a lot of stuff happening and we would give feedback to Twitter and they would respond by saying that they are trying out stuff. I know that Elon is a very polarising figure. There are some people who love him and some who absolutely hate him and there is no middle ground. But I think that he is trying something and I am really excited to see what happens and where it goes. The blue tick has represented something till now but we don\u2019t know about now. It might change, it might not change.\nTwitter Blue was going to roll out the \u2018edit\u2019 button. But with Elon Musk\u2019s takeover, things might change.\nRight, we don\u2019t have much clarity over what might happen. And honestly, I have survived Twitter without the \u2018edit\u2019 button for 16 years, I am not going to pay for it.\nWe pay a subscription fee to a lot of platforms like, say, Netflix and we get to watch movies in return. What about Twitter? Do you think that the USD 8 per month fee will be worth it?\nNo. I don\u2019t know, honestly. I really need to know what the blue tick would mean in the future. And if it is adding value, then, yeah, sure. The value it has added so far is that people know that it\u2019s actually me that they're talking to, it\u2019s me who they\u2019re getting in touch with. I don\u2019t think that the blue tick adds value to me in any way. Again, I would really need to see where it's going and what they're planning to do, to be honest.\nEven if we don\u2019t have verified accounts, the normal accounts still add value to a platform like twitter.\nDon\u2019t you think that the blue tick helps us differentiate between the parody/fake accounts from the actual/verified accounts?\nIf it\u2019s a political figure, I think it's important for them to have a blue tick to say that this is in fact the real person. I don\u2019t face the same issues that Narendra Modi or Rahul Gandhi would face. And I'm sure that politicians have deep pockets and paying those $8 dollars would be nothing for them.\nDo you think that the subscription plan would be successful in India, given that all the plan provides is a verification badge?\nI will not subscribe. I cannot say for anyone else in India but I wouldn\u2019t take the plan. The reason I have, say, a Spotify premium account is because I don\u2019t want to listen to ads. I have twitter and I can\u2019t really delete my account since I am the first user but paying Twitter the money wouldn\u2019t add any value to my life so I don\u2019t see why I would subscribe to anything on Twitter.\nDon\u2019t you think that if Twitter takes this up, other platforms might start their own subscription plan for a \u2018no-ad\u2019 policy?\nNo, I don\u2019t think so. What other platforms are there, really? If you talk about Instagram, it's really hard to decipher if it's an ad, a paid promotion, or just some page that I already follow. There are some ads that are actually useful and I really like. Instagram\u2019s ad algorithm is really quick and picks up what you\u2019re looking for but that\u2019s not the case with Twitter. Twitter really needs to work on its ad algorithm.\nDo you think people are migrating to other platforms like Koo or Mastodon?\nI have heard of a lot of platforms and have tried them but they can't compete with what twitter has to offer, the loyalty that Twitter has had. They were the first platform to do what they did and it took off for them. So, I think no one can compete with Twitter. Even if people don\u2019t end up paying the $8, they will continue using the free account but they're not migrating to another platform. Twitter has the audience and the major population on it. Unless there is a mass exodus and Elon Musk really messes it up, I don\u2019t it's going to change. Everybody wants to be where everyone else is.\nThis is the most people have spoken about Twitter on Twitter. I'm really excited with what Musk plans to do with the platform.\nWatch the full interview here:\n\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "Kiran Rao decodes why South movies are giving Bollywood a run for its money: 'Even their horror films...'",
        "BOLLYWOOD\nKiran shared that the makers in South cinema are ready to take chances as it's a small industry, and they know their audience very well.\nVarsha Agarwal\nUpdated : Mar 08, 2025, 09:25 PM IST\nFilmmaker Kiran Rao candidly discussed the Bollywood vs South Cinema debate and said that she finds a \"sense of conviction\" when it comes to telling stories in South films.\nIn a conversation with ANI, she said, \"I watch a lot of Malayalam films, and what I'm always struck by is how they really seem very bold in their story choices. 'Uleri', which was released last year, is such a bold story idea. Even their horror films, like I saw a film called 'Bramayugam,' which is a Mammootty film, incredibly artistically made using folk tales and the folklore of Kerala, and it's a very different idea. There is a sort of a sense of conviction about telling stories that are different. And I think that's what stands them in great stead.\"\nKiran, however, shared that the makers in South cinema are ready to take chances as it's a small industry, and they know their audience very well. \"It's the chances that they are taking with the stories they are telling, and perhaps that also comes from the fact that they are usually smaller industries that are technically only catering to their own, culturally, their language and their community. And so they are quite unafraid to try different things. They know their audience, and their producers are willing to take chances on new storytelling,\" she added.\nShe said what is incredible is that \"the audience is going to watch films,\" and the makers are \"very much in touch with their audience. They understand their audience very well.\" However, she shared that Bollywood is big, and while making the movie, filmmakers keep in mind that they have to cater for a \"wider audience\". \"You are making films for a diaspora, you are making films for all the states of the country. And I think maybe that is why people want to make something that they are very sure will succeed, and maybe that's why there's a tendency to go to a film that's already successful, like a remake,\" she said. She insisted that it is important to have \"producers who are willing to take a chance\" if you are willing to have a different cinema.\nRao started her career as the assistant director in the epic film 'Lagaan', directed by Ashutosh Gowariker, whom she also assisted later on 'Swades: We, the People'. Lagaan was nominated for the 74th Academy Award in the foreign language film category. Aamir Khan produced and starred in the same film. Before 'Lagaan', she also played a minute role as a supporting actress in 'Dil Chahta Hai'. She has directed the films 'Dhobi Ghat' (2011) and 'Laapataa Ladies' (2024).\n\r\n\t(This story has not been edited by DNA staff and is published from ANI)\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

The high-speed rail will run on a 260-kilometer elevated track, passing through five key districts, including Patna. The National High-Speed Rail Corporation Limited (NHSRCL) is working on the project, with the Detailed Project Report (DPR) expected to be completed by August, according to reports.\nThis bullet train will be a part of the Varanasi-Patna-Howrah High-Speed Rail Corridor, covering a total distance of 800 kilometers. In Bihar, the train will pass through Patna, Buxar, Ara, Jehanabad, and Gaya.\nThe project will be completed in two phases. The first phase will connect Varanasi to Howrah via important stations like Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya Junction, Ara, Buxar, Patna, and Gaya. The second phase will extend the route from Delhi to Varanasi, linking Delhi to Howrah through a high-speed network.\nThe bullet train in Bihar will run at a top speed of 350 km/h, drastically cutting travel time. It will be based on Japanese technology and will feature modern amenities such as automatic doors, CCTV cameras for security, and mobile charging points for passenger convenience.\nIn Patna alone, the project will require around 135 hectares of land across 58 villages. Authorities have started the land acquisition process, offering four times the market value for rural land and twice the market value for urban properties, according to reports.\nThe NHSRCL is set to appoint an agency to finalise the DPR, which will outline costs, timelines, and technical details.

        "Gautam Adani's heartfelt message on International Women's Day: 'As I cradled my first granddaughter's delicate fingers...'",
        "INDIA\nOn the occasion of International Women's Day, Adani Group, Chairman, Gautam Adani reaffirmed his commitment to gender equality and empowering women in all walks of life.\nMeemansa Shekhawat\nUpdated : Mar 08, 2025, 01:44 PM IST\nOn the occasion of International Women's Day, Adani Group, Chairman, Gautam Adani reaffirmed his commitment to gender equality and empowering women in all walks of life. In a heartfelt message, he shared how his granddaughters have strengthened his resolve to build a world where women face no barriers in achieving their dreams. Gautam Adani spoke about the strong women who shaped his journey, including his mother, wife Priti Adani, and others that he met through his work.\nHe recalled how his mother managed their large family with resilience and how his wife's dedication to the Adani Foundation has transformed lives across rural India.\nIn a social media post he said, \"A decade ago, as I cradled my first granddaughter's delicate fingers, I made a silent vow: to help build a world where her aspirations would know no bounds, where her voice would resonate with the same respect as any man's, and where her worth would be measured solely by her character and contributions\".\nHe further added, \"Now, blessed with three beautiful granddaughters, this promise burns brighter and more urgent than ever. International Women's Day is not merely a date on the calendar; it's a poignant reminder of the strides we've made and the journey that still lies ahead. For me, this mission is deeply personal across many dimensions - as a young boy being inspired by his mother, as a business leader witnessing the challenges faced by women in leadership, as a husband inspired by my wife Priti's unwavering dedication to the Adani Foundation, and as a grandfather dreaming of a world without limits for the girls who affectionately call me \"Dadu.\"\nHe also highlighted key initiatives by the Adani Foundation, such as the Butterfly Effect framework, which supports women throughout different stages of life, and the Lakhpati Didis program, which has helped over 1,000 women achieve financial independence.\nHe said \"Moreover, our 'Lakhpati Didis' initiative celebrates over 1,000 women who have achieved financial independence through enhanced entrepreneurial skills\". Gautam Adani shared a personal experience of visiting one of his company's ports, where he noticed the lack of women in leadership roles. This led him to push for change, ensuring policies were more inclusive and providing mentorship opportunities for women.\nHe added, \"Several years ago, during a visit to one of our port projects, I noticed the absence of women in operational and leadership roles. It was not due to a lack of capability but rather the absence of pathways for them into these traditionally male-dominated fields. This realization sparked a personal commitment to change\".\nDespite progress, he acknowledged that many women still face challenges in leadership roles. He expressed hope that his granddaughters would one day enter boardrooms where they are valued as equals.\nGautam Adani said, \"Yet, beneath that pride is a quiet impatience. Because despite how far we have come, my granddaughters may still enter boardrooms where they are the only women at the table. They may still have to fight harder, speak louder, and prove themselves twice over to receive the recognition they deserve. They may still face doors that open too slowly, or not at all\".\nFor his granddaughters he added \"And to my granddaughters, who may one day read this: My dearest girls, The world you inherit should be one where your brilliance is met with open doors, not glass ceilings. Where your ambitions are never questioned, only encouraged. Where your voice is not just heard, but sought after. I vow to keep pushing, to keep breaking barriers, until that world is not just a vision but a reality. Because you, and every girl like you, deserve to walk into every room knowing you belong. Your Dadu.\"\nConcluding his message, he urged men in leadership positions to see gender equality as a shared responsibility, stating, \"The talents, insights, and leadership of women are invaluable resources we cannot afford to squander.\n\"This year's International Women's Day theme, Accelerate Action, resonates deeply with vision of creating an inclusive future where every woman can thrive\".\nExcept for the headline, the story has not been edited by DNA staff and is published from ANI.\n\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "INDIA\nIn a surprising turn of events in Madhya Praesh's Ratlam, a man, deemed to be in coma, walked out of the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) on his own and exposed an alleged medical fraud done by the private hospital where he was admitted.\nMeemansa Shekhawat\nUpdated : Mar 08, 2025, 07:32 AM IST\nIn a surprising turn of events in Madhya Praesh's Ratlam, a man, deemed to be in coma, walked out of the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) on his own and exposed an alleged medical fraud done by the private hospital where he was admitted.\nThe man has claimed that he was being held captive in the hospital while his family was forced to pay Rs one lakh for his treatment, which now appears to be \"unnecessary\".\nAccording to a report by the Free Press Journal, Banti Ninama, a resident of Deendayal Nagar, was admitted to the hospital after sustaining injuries in a fight. His family was told by the doctors that he had slipped into a coma and that he required immediate medical attention and expensive treatment.\nFearing for his life, Ninama's wife and mother somehow started arranging the money, borrowing from friends and relatives. However, what happened next shocked everyone! In a viral video, now being widely circulated online, Ninama casually walked out the hospital with no signs of the severe condition he was being kept in the hospital for.\nHe alleged that he was forcibly held captive by five doctors, while they pressurised his family for the large amount of money. Despite this, he managed to escape their custody, later exposing them over their reported scam.\n\nA post shared by Jist (@jist.news)\nLater, his wife confirmed the incident and said, \"They told us he had a spinal fracture and had fallen into a coma. They handed us prescriptions, and we bought everything they asked for. Then, they told us to pay Rs 1 lakh for the treatment. We had to beg our relatives for money. We ran from one place to another and finally managed to gather the amount\".\nThe incident has sparked concerns over irrationally expensive treatment costs charged by private hospitals, with netizens demanding stricter regulations to curb such unfair practices.\n\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "Amid tariff war, Donald Trump hints at revisiting US-Canada border demarcation treaty",
        "WORLD\nThe report, which cited four people with firsthand knowledge of their content, on the condition of anonymity, also noted that Trump, in an early February call, challenged the border treaty between the two countries and told Trudeau he didn't like their shared water agreements.\nSagar Malik\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 08:58 AM IST\nAmid the ongoing tariff war between the two countries, US President Donald Trump, during his conversation with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, raised the point that he did not believe in the border demarcation treaty between them and wants to revise the boundary, the New York Times reported.\nThe report, which cited four people with firsthand knowledge of their content, on the condition of anonymity, also noted that Trump, in an early February call, challenged the border treaty between the two countries and told Trudeau he didn't like their shared water agreements.\nRecently, Justin Trudeau made an extraordinary statement that was largely lost in the fray of the moment, as per NYT.\r\n\t\"The excuse that he's giving for these tariffs today of fentanyl is completely bogus, completely unjustified, completely false,\" Trudeau told the news media in Ottawa.\n\"What he wants is to see a total collapse of the Canadian economy, because that'll make it easier to annex us,\" he added.\r\n\tThe conversation between Washington and Ottawa on February 3 not only included discussions on staving off tariffs on Canadian exports but Trump also laid out a long list of grievances he had with the trade relationship between the two countries, including Canada's protected dairy sector, the difficulty American banks face in doing business in Canada and Canadian consumption taxes that Trump deems unfair because they make American goods more expensive.\nNotably, the border treaty that Trump referred to was established in 1908 and finalized the international boundary between Canada, then a British dominion, and the United States, as reported by NYT.\nTrump also mentioned revisiting the sharing of lakes and rivers between the two nations, which is regulated by a number of treaties, a topic he's expressed interest in in the past.\nThe report further cited Trump's response to the media on January 7, wherein, he had said that he is planning to use \"economic force\" against Canada.\nThe persistent social media references to Canada as the \"51st state\" and Trudeau as its \"Governor\" had begun to grate both inside the Canadian government and more broadly, as reported by NYT.\nFollowing the talks between the two leaders, Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick in a conversation with Canada's finance minister, Dominic LeBlanc, issued a devastating message, according to several people familiar with the call that Trump, he said, had come to realize that the relationship between the United States and Canada was governed by a slew of agreements and treaties that were 'easy to abandon.'\nHe also wanted to eject Canada out of an intelligence-sharing group known as the 'Five Eyes' that also includes Britain, Australia and New Zealand, according to NYT.\nHe wanted to tear up the Great Lakes agreements and conventions between the two nations that lay out how they share and manage Lakes Superior, Huron, Erie and Ontario, the report further added.\nIt also noted that he is also reviewing military cooperation between the two countries, particularly the North American Aerospace Defence Command.\nA sigh of relief, however, has been that the Secretary of State Marco Rubio, has refrained from delivering threats, and recently dismissed the idea that the United States was looking at scrapping military cooperation.\nHowever, Canada's politicians across the spectrum, and Canadian society at large, are frayed and deeply concerned. Officials do not see the Trump administration's threats as empty; they see a new normal when it comes to the United States, the report added.\n\r\n\t(This story has not been edited by DNA staff and is published from ANI).\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "Trump, Musk, NASA, and SpaceX: The fight over Sunita Williams\u2019 return",
        "WORLD\nPresident Donald Trump said he had personally asked Elon Musk for help in bringing astronauts back from the International Space Station. He also used the moment to criticize President Biden and his administration.\nGirish Linganna\nUpdated : Mar 08, 2025, 06:29 PM IST\nPresident Donald Trump said he had personally asked Elon Musk for help in bringing astronauts back from the International Space Station. He also used the moment to criticize President Biden and his administration.\nThe SpaceX Dragon spacecraft, which will bring astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore back to Earth, has been at the space station since September and was always supposed to bring them back home. Even so, Trump mentioned in the Oval Office on Thursday, March 6, that he had given Elon permission a week earlier to bring them back.\nTrump also said that former President Joe Biden felt embarrassed about the situation and decided to leave them there.\nThe astronauts earlier told CNN's Anderson Cooper that they don\u2019t feel \"stuck\" at the space station. However, NASA and the astronauts have struggled to completely dismiss this idea, partly because of the political back-and-forth involving Trump and Musk.\nWilmore reassured Cooper on February 13 that they don\u2019t feel abandoned, stuck, or stranded. He was responding to a question about Trump\u2019s remarks, as reported by USA Today.\nWhat\u2019s the latest with the Starliner?\nAstronauts Wilmore and Williams were chosen for the first crewed flight of the Starliner. In June 2024, they launched on a mission to test the Boeing Starliner, which is designed to eventually carry NASA astronauts to space alongside SpaceX\u2019s Dragon.\nBoth astronauts are highly experienced and are making their third trip to the space station.\nNASA found technical problems with the spacecraft, which delayed the astronauts' return home. In the end, the space agency had to bring the Starliner back to Earth in early September without its crew.\nThe SpaceX Dragon spacecraft, which will now bring astronauts Williams and Wilmore back to Earth, has been at the space station since late September. It originally arrived with the Crew-9 mission.\nAs part of NASA's plan, the spacecraft carried only two astronauts instead of the usual four. This left extra seats available for Williams and Wilmore on the trip back to Earth.\nThe Boeing\u00a0 Starliner crew members, Sunita Williams and Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore, joined the Crew-9 mission, whose astronauts are still completing their full stay in space.\nNASA announced in a mission update that the Dragon capsule, carrying the four astronauts of Crew-10, is set to launch as early as March 12. It will travel on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Kennedy Space Center in Florida, replacing the Crew-9 team.\nAs the name implies, this is the 10th crew rotation mission to the space station under NASA's commercial crew program.\nAstronaut Hague said in a news conference from space on Tuesday, March 4, that Crew-9 will pass the mission to Crew-10 before returning to Earth after a successful long stay.\nWhen the new astronauts reach the space station, there will be a few days of handover activities. After that, Williams and Wilmore will join Crew-9 in the SpaceX Dragon to leave the station, possibly around March 25.\nNASA astronaut Nick Hague will lead the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft as it returns to Earth, along with Mission Specialists Suni Williams, Butch Wilmore, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov. The crew practiced on Tuesday, 4th March using Dragon's computer tablets and reviewed the steps needed for the spacecraft to move away from the space station and reenter Earth's atmosphere before landing in the ocean near Florida. Hague and Gorbunov have been on the station since September 29, 2024, while Williams and Wilmore arrived on June 6.\n\n(The author Girish Linganna of this article is an award-winning Science Writer and a Defence, Aerospace & Political Analyst based in Bengaluru.

        "Syria revenge killings: Over 1000 dead in 2 days of violence as security forces clash with Assad loyalists, here's all you need to know",
        "WORLD\nThe clashes began between government forces and supporters of former President Bashar Assad and later escalated into revenge killings\nShivam Verma\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 02:07 PM IST\nSyria has witnessed one of its deadliest incidents in recent years, with more than 1,000 people killed in just two days of violence. According to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the clashes began between government forces and supporters of former President Bashar Assad and later escalated into revenge killings.\nDeadly clashes and retaliation\nThe violence has claimed the lives of at least 745 civilians, including many who were killed at close range. Additionally, 125 government security personnel and 148 militants linked to Assad lost their lives. Large parts of Latakia province have been left without electricity and drinking water as a result of the fighting.\nThe conflict started on Thursday when security forces tried to arrest a wanted individual near Jableh. However, they were ambushed by Assad loyalists, leading to intense clashes, as reported by the Associated Press (AP).\nTargeting of Alawites\nOn Friday, the violence took a dangerous turn when Sunni Muslim gunmen, who support the government, began targeting Alawites, the minority sect to which Assad belongs. The attacks have created a significant challenge for Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the group that played a key role in removing Assad from power.\nResidents described horrifying scenes of brutality in Alawite villages. Ali Sheha, a 57-year-old from Baniyas, told AP, \u201cBodies were on the streets. The gunmen were less than 100 meters away, firing at homes and residents.\u201d He added that the attackers checked people\u2019s IDs to confirm their sect before killing them.\nInternational reactions\nThe Syrian government has claimed that it has regained control over most of the areas captured by Assad loyalists. Meanwhile, France has strongly condemned the violence. A statement from the French foreign ministry said, \u201cParis condemns in the strongest possible terms atrocities committed against civilians on religious grounds.\u201d\nThousands of Alawites have fled their homes, with many seeking shelter at Russia\u2019s Hmeimim airbase. Lebanese legislator Haidar Nasser urged the international community to protect Alawites, stating, \u201cThe international community should protect Alawites, who are Syrian citizens loyal to their country.\u201d\nAs tensions remain high, the situation in Syria continues to be fragile, with fears of further violence and instability.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "US millionaire Bryan Johnson launches \u2018Don\u2019t Die\u2019: A new \u2018Religion\u2019 for longevity",
        "VIRAL\nUS millionaire Bryan Johnson launched the \"Don't Die\" movement, aiming to create a new religion focused on longevity and merging humanity with AI.\nPravrajya Suruchi\nUpdated : Mar 08, 2025, 05:15 PM IST\nUS millionaire Bryan Johnson recently announced his ambitious plans to \"save humankind\" and launch a new religion called \"Don\u2019t Die\" amid the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). Through a detailed thread on X (formerly Twitter), Johnson introduced his new app and urged people to join the movement to become those who will be \u201cadmired and respected\u201d by the 25th century.\nWhat is 'Don\u2019t Die'?\r\n\tJohnson explained that \"Don\u2019t Die\" is not just an ideology but a framework for transitioning into the era of AI while focusing on longevity and wellness. He stated, \"Don\u2019t Die becomes history's fastest-growing ideology. It saves the human race and ushers in an existence more spectacular than we can imagine. It is inevitable. The only question is: will you be an early or late adopter?\"\nOn a personal level, Johnson shared that he has been living by the \"Don\u2019t Die\" principles for years. This includes maintaining a healthy lifestyle by eating well, exercising regularly, and managing stress. He also focuses on improving his body's health through scientific measurement and protocols. Johnson claims that these practices have given him \"the slowest aging speed in recorded history.\"\nWhy Now?\r\n\tJohnson revealed that his inspiration came from a thought experiment where he imagined himself interacting with people from the 25th century. He believed they would view \"Don\u2019t Die\" as the key to how humanity saved itself and merged with AI. To turn this idea into a global movement, he invited people to become \"Don\u2019t Die Citizens\" by downloading the app, tracking their \"Don\u2019t Die Score,\" connecting with others, and starting local communities.\nMixed Reactions on Social Media\r\n\tJohnson\u2019s post received mixed reactions. Some expressed enthusiasm, with one user saying they would organize meetups and activities for \"Don\u2019t Die\" in Michigan. Others were skeptical, questioning whether the new \"religion\" would cost money or if it was better described as a movement rather than a religion.\nOne user commented, \u201cIt\u2019s a mistake to call it a religion as most people already have one and don\u2019t believe in having two. Better to call it a movement, ideology, something else that isn\u2019t generally considered mutually exclusive.\u201d Another joked, \u201cMy knee literally won\u2019t stop jerking,\u201d referring to Johnson's request to hold back a knee-jerk reaction.\nBryan Johnson's Journey\r\n\tBryan Johnson, founder and CEO of Kernel Holding SA, gained global attention after Bloomberg published an article titled \u201cHow to Be 18 Years Old Again for Only $2 Million a Year.\u201d Since then, he has been openly documenting his journey to reverse aging, often stating his ultimate goal: to not die.\nJohnson's vision for \"Don\u2019t Die\" is to merge scientific wellness practices with AI-driven advancements, offering a pathway to a healthier, longer life and possibly the future of humanity. Whether this idea will gain widespread acceptance or remain a niche movement is yet to be seen.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "BOLLYWOOD\nApoorva's absence from the film's premiere and her silence on social media about her role in the movie had sparked curiosity. Adding to the mystery, the cast members had not tagged her in their posts, amidst her ongoing legal issues.\nVarsha Agarwal\nUpdated : Mar 08, 2025, 05:25 PM IST\nThe recently-released Nadaaniyan features Ibrahim Ali Khan and Khushi Kapoor in lead roles, alongside an ensemble cast including Mahima Chaudhary, Suniel Shetty, Dia Mirza, and Jugal Hansraj. The film also includes influencer Apoorva Makhija, who is currently embroiled in a controversy surrounding India's Got Latent show. Interestingly, the cast members have not tagged Apoorva in their social media posts, sparking speculation about whether this was a deliberate snub or a decision made by her team.\nWas Apoorva Makhija deliberately snubbed from Nadaaniyan?\nApoorva's absence from the film's premiere and her silence on social media about her role in the movie had sparked curiosity. Adding to the mystery, the cast members had not tagged her in their posts, amidst her ongoing legal issues. Her co-star Agasthya Shah shared behind-the-scenes photos from the film's set on Instagram, tagging Ibrahim Ali Khan, Khushi Kapoor, and others. Notably, one of the images featured Apoorva, but she was conspicuously left out of the tags. Even other cast members including Neel, Aaliyah, and Dev, shared a group photo from the film's set, but none of them tagged Apoorva.\nFans spotted her in the image and began questioning why she wasn't tagged.Comments flooded in, with some expressing delight at seeing her, such as \"Finally saw Apoorva after a long time\". Others wondered why she wasn't tagged, with comments like \"Oh, she didn\u2019t tag the Rebel kid\", \"Why isn\u2019t Apoorva tagged?\", \"Rebel absence is just not so done\", and \"Why is no one tagging Rebel Kid?\". However, the mystery was solved when a fan revealed that Apoorva had turned off Instagram's tagging feature, preventing anyone from tagging her in posts. This move is likely an attempt to avoid unwanted negativity and harassment on social media amid her ongoing controversy.\n\nApoorva Makhija's controversy\nApoorva is currently embroiled in controversy surrounding Ranveer Allahbadia's comments on Samay Raina's show, India's Got Latent. The National Commission for Women (NCW) has summoned Apoorva, Ranveer, Samay Raina, Ashish Chanchlani, and others in connection with the issue. The controversy began when Allahbadia made offensive remarks about parental sex on the show, sparking widespread outrage and multiple complaints against him.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

This match also marks the conclusion of their home leg in Lucknow, and they are eager to end their disappointing campaign on a positive note. Unfortunately, the Warriorz were knocked out of the playoffs race after the results from Friday night, with the Gujarat Giants securing eight points. This situation has also placed the Royal Challengers Bengaluru in a must-win scenario following a string of losses during their home leg.\nThe Indian players, especially in batting, have faced challenges for the Warriorz, with Grace Harris, Georgia Voll, Chinelle Henry, and Sophie Ecclestone all needing to elevate their game. While Uma Chetry, Vrinda Dinesh, and Kiran Navgire have shown potential, their performances haven't been sufficient to back up the overseas stars. Even captain Deepti Sharma has struggled to make a significant impact.\nOn the flip side, RCB is counting on captain Smriti Mandhana to guide the team to victory. The team's reliance on Ellyse Perry has revealed vulnerabilities in the lineup, particularly with some key players absent. Sneh Rana and Kim Garth, stepping in as replacements, have done well, but RCB needs their top players to rise to the occasion. RCB must secure wins in two consecutive matches to compete with the Giants and the Mumbai Indians for a playoff spot. Thus, the upcoming match against the UP Warriorz is vital for the defending champions as they wrap up their league stage at the CCI against Mumbai.\nLive Streaming Details\nThe Women's Premier League (WPL) 2025 match between UP Warriorz and Royal Challengers Bengaluru is scheduled to take place on Saturday, March 8. The match will be held at the Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow , with kick-off set for 7:30 PM IST. Fans can catch all the action live on the Sports18 Network, for those unable to watch on TV, the match will also be available for live streaming on the JioCinema app and website.\nPitch report\nIn the matches played at the venue, Gujarat scored the highest score of 186 in the first game. The subsequent games saw a decrease in total scores, with UP scoring 150 and Gujarat chasing a total of 177 in the following match. Lucknow has hosted three games, with the 150-run mark being surpassed in five out of six innings. Spinners have been more successful than fast bowlers, with a better average and economy rate compared to seamers.\nWeather report\nThe weather at Ekana Stadium will be warm with hazy sunshine, temperatures around 32 degrees, and a RealFeel of 33 degrees. However, the air quality will be very unhealthy. There will be a gentle breeze from the west-northwest at 11 km/h, occasionally shifting the stagnant air with gusts up to 28 km/h, creating a mix of warmth and discomfort.\nPredicted playing XIs\nUP Warriorz: Kiran Navgire, Grace Harris, Georgia Voll, Vrinda Dinesh, Deepti Sharma (c), Shweta Sehrawat, Chinelle Henry, Uma Chetry (wk), Sophie Ecclestone, Kranti Goud, Gouher Sultana/Saima Thakor\nRoyal Challengers Bengaluru: Smriti Mandhana (c), Danielle Wyatt-Hodge, Ellyse Perry, Raghvi Bist/S Meghana, Kanika Ahuja, Richa Ghosh (wk), Georgia Wareham, Kim Garth, Sneh Rana, Renuka Singh Thakur, Ekta Bisht/Prema Rawat\nAlso read| UPW-W vs RCB-W WPL 2025 Dream11 prediction: Fantasy cricket tips for UP Warriorz Women vs Royal Challengers Bengaluru Women\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

The president made his case for his reciprocal tariffs, which will commence April 2. He wants to impose the same tariff on imports from foreign countries as those nations impose on US exports. \"Other countries have used tariffs against us for decades and now it's our turn to start using them against those other countries. On average, the European Union, China, Brazil, India, - Mexico and Canada - Have you heard of them -and countless other nations charge us tremendously higher tariffs than we charge them.

In February, President Trump has said that his administration will \u201csoon\u201d impose reciprocal tariffs on countries such as India and China, reiterating what he had said during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the US capital last month.\n\r\n\tTrump has made it clear to Prime Minister Modi that India will not be spared from Washington's reciprocal tariffs and emphasised that \u201cnobody can argue with me\u201d on tariff structure.\n\r\n\t\"China's average tariff on our products is twice... And South Korea's average tariff is four times higher. Think of that, four times higher. And we give so much help militarily and in so many other ways to South Korea. But that's what happens. This is happening by friend and foe. This system is not fair to the United States. It never was,\u201d he said.\n\r\n\tTrump added that from April 2, reciprocal tariffs will kick in, and whatever \u201cthey tariff us, other countries, we will tariff them. That's reciprocal back and forth. Whatever they tax us, we will tax them. If they do non-monetary tariffs to keep us out of their market, then we will do non-monetary barriers to keep them out of our market.\n\r\n\t\"They don't even allow us in their market. We will take in trillions and trillions of dollars that create jobs like we have never seen before. I did it with China, and I did it with others, and the Biden administration couldn't do anything about it because there was so much money they couldn't do anything about it.\u201d \u201cWe have been ripped off for decades by nearly every country on Earth, and we will not let that happen any longer,\u201d Trump said.\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by DNA staff and is published from PTI)\n\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "LIFESTYLE\nNita Ambani and Mukesh Ambani are celebrating their 40th wedding anniversary today.\nSonali Sharma\nUpdated : Mar 08, 2025, 06:46 PM IST\nPower couple Nita Ambani and Mukesh Ambani are celebrating their 40th wedding anniversary today, 8th March. They tied the knot on this day in 1985. Over the years, they have become some of the most influential figures in India.\nAs they celebrate 40 years together, it\u2019s worth noting that Nita Ambani is not only the wife of businessman Mukesh Ambani but also the chairperson and founder of the Reliance Foundation. Her personality and philanthropic work even impressed Mukesh\u2019s father, who chose her as the perfect match for his son.\nOn the occasion of Nita Ambani\u2019s 60th birthday, let\u2019s look back at how their love story began and how the two eventually got married.\nIt sounds like something from a fairy tale when Mukesh and Nita Ambani first meet. The renowned Reliance founder Dhirubhai Ambani first saw Nita when she was performing Bharatnatyam at a cultural event. He was struck by her grace and talent and thought she would be a perfect match for his son, Mukesh. He personally contacted Nita and suggested a meeting with Mukesh, taking everything into his own hands. This simple suggestion set the stage for what would later become an iconic love story.\nAs Mukesh and Nita spent more time together, their bond deepened. In a memorable moment that cemented their relationship, Mukesh made a spontaneous yet powerful proposal to Nita. One day when they were driving, Mukesh pulled to a stop at a light, turned to face Nita, and proposed marriage.\u00a0 Nita hesitated, taken aback by the sudden proposition.\u00a0 Then, in jest, Mukesh threatened to stop starting the car until she responded.\u00a0 This lighthearted yet sincere gesture won Nita\u2019s heart, and she said yes, beginning a partnership that has flourished over the years.\nMukesh and Nita have consistently supported one another as a relationship.\u00a0 Nita oversaw a number of important projects in the fields of sports, healthcare, and education when Mukesh assumed control of Reliance Industries. She was instrumental in the formation of the Mumbai Indians IPL cricket team and rose to become the chairman of the Dhirubhai Ambani International School. Through her work with the Reliance Foundation, Nita has promoted several charitable initiatives throughout India, demonstrating her dedication to the community.\nAs they celebrate their 40th wedding anniversary, Nita Ambani and Mukesh Ambani continue to inspire, showing how a deep connection and a shared commitment to family and community can create an enduring legacy.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

Among her many prized jewels, one gemstone holds a special place in her heart \u2014 the emerald. But for Nita Ambani, this dazzling green gem is more than just an accessory; it is believed to bring good luck, prosperity, and positivity.\nIn astrology, emerald, known as \u2018panna\u2019 in Hindi, is associated with financial stability, health benefits, and good fortune. Many believe that wearing an emerald can attract wealth and success, making it a powerful symbol of abundance. It is also linked to Goddess Lakshmi, the deity of prosperity, further enhancing its spiritual significance.\nEmeralds have been valued throughout history, particularly in Indian culture. Ancient rulers and Mughal emperors admired their rich green color and mystical properties. In Western traditions, emeralds are connected to Venus, the Roman goddess of love and beauty, symbolizing nature, fertility, and eternal youth.\nBeyond its cultural and spiritual significance, emeralds are also believed to have health benefits. Some say the gemstone can help reduce eye problems and bring emotional balance. It is also thought to drive away negativity, replacing it with peace and positivity.\nMany people admire Nita Ambani\u2019s success and see her love for emeralds as a reflection of her belief in their positive energy. For her, the emerald is not just a beautiful gemstone but a symbol of faith, prosperity, and well-being.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

This is the third consecutive time the Indian side has reached to the finals of the Champions Trophy.\nAseem Sharma\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 02:55 PM IST\nIndia vs New Zealand Live Cricket Score: Rohit Sharma-led Men in Blue are set to lock horns against Mitchell Santner's Blackcaps in the Final match of the ICC Champions Trophy 2025. After clinching a semi-final game against the World Champions Australia, Team India became the first team to reach the finals. On the other hand, the Kiwis defeated the South African side to make it to the finals. Both the teams faced each other in the tournament in the league stage and the game was won by Team India convincingly. Interestingly, India has reached the finals of the Champions Trophy for the third consecutive time, lifting the trophy in 2013 and losing the final match against Pakistan in 2017. So, stay tuned to this space for all the latest and live updates about the IND vs NZ game.\nAfter winning the crucial toss, New Zealand openers Will Young and Rachin Ravindra have provided a good start to their team. After 5 overs, NZ 37/0.\nWill Young hits the first boundary of the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 Final. After 1 over, NZ 4/0 with Young and Rachin out in the middle.\n\n\nNew Zealand (Playing XI) - Will Young, Rachin Ravindra, Kane Williamson, Daryl Mitchell, Tom Latham (WK), Glenn Phillips, Michael Bracewell, Mitchell Santner (C), Nathan Smith (In for Matt Henry), Kyle Jamieson, Will O Rourke.\nIndia (Unchanged Playing XI) - Rohit Sharma (C), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, Axar Patel, KL Rahul (WK), Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, Mohammad Shami, Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakaravarthy.\n\nBad luck for the Indian skipper in the toss continues as he lost his 12th straight one today. New Zealand skipper Mitchell Santner elected to bat first against the Men in Blue in the Final of ICC Champions Trophy 2025.\n\n\nIndia's star player Virat Kohli suffered a minor knee injury one day ahead of the Champions Trophy 2025 Final match. Fans are worried about Kohli's fitness for an important game like today's and this question will be answered when skipper Rohit Sharma arrives for the toss.\nOn the other hand, New Zealand's star pacer Matt Henry, who has taken important wickets in the tournament so far, suffered a shoulder injury while fielding in the semi-final match against South Africa.\n\nThe Indian skipper, who might be leading the team in winning matches in ICC events, has been facing tough luck in the toss. He has lost 11 consecutive toss in a row. So, will Rohit be able to put an end to this unique streak in today's game?\n\nA post shared by ICC (@icc)\nSeveral reports recently claimed that skipper Rohit Sharma might take retirement from the 50-over format just like he did after clinching the T20 World Cup. Speaking on the ongoing rumours, former skipper Sourav Ganguly said, ''Why is there talk of Rohit Sharma's retirement? Why is this even a question? He won the World Cup just a few months ago. I don't know what the selectors are thinking, Rohit is playing very well.''\n''India is far better than New Zealand. India played in the 2023 World Cup finals, won the 2024 T20 World Cup, and they are still unbeaten in this Champions Trophy. The same team will play,'' India Today reported quoting Sourav.\n\nTotal Matches Played - 119\nIndia - 61\nNew Zealand - 50\nTied - 1\nNo Result - 7\n\nThe Final of the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 between India and New Zealand can be viewed on Star Sports network and Jio Hotstar for live streaming on OTT.\nIndia and New Zealand have faced each other five times in the knockout stages of ICC tournaments wherein the Blackcaps have come out on top three times while the Men in Blue tasted success twice. Interestingly, India beat New Zealand in the 2000 edition of the Champions Trophy (then ICC KnockOut Trophy) in the quarterfinals but lost the game in the Final match by 4 wickets.\nBoth India and New Zealand have lifted the Champions Trophy in the past. While the Blackcaps clinched the inaugural tournament (then ICC KnockOut Trophy), Team India won the Champions Trophy in 2013 and shared the title with Sri Lanka in 2002.\nA post shared by ICC (@icc)\nTeam India's vice-captain Shubman Gill has given an update on whether skipper Rohit Sharma is retiring or not from the 50-over format after the completion of the ongoing ICC event. Speaking at the pre-match conference, Gill said, ''No discussion in the dressing room or with me, even Rohit bhai would be thinking about the Champions Trophy final lime all of us. So, nothing like that now.''\n''I think once the match ends tomorrow, he will make a decision. There is no talk about it within the setup,'' he added.\n\nThe New Zealand captain is confident of his team's ability ahead of the Champions Trophy Final. ''It's easy to say it's just another game, it's obviously not, but I think the way you approach it has to be the same. We've done a lot of good stuff this tournament, we're just trying to progress and build on the things we've been doing as a team.''\nThe New Zealand captain is confident of his team's ability ahead of the #ChampionsTrophy Final\n\r\n\t\tMore from Mitchell Santner https://t.co/1nUEF7mnrc pic.twitter.com/vgoTyITBFz\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

Taking to X on Friday, the Thyrocare founder emphasised that ego can weaken relationships and create unnecessary pain.\nQuoting a message that read, \u201cEgo must be left behind to start any business,\u201d he added, \u201cNot just for business alone. Be it career or marriage, ego amplifies pains and erases pleasures. Stronger the ego, weaker are relationships.\u201d\nHis post sparked discussions among netizens. One user commented, \u201cI read somewhere long ago that ego stands for EDGING GOOD OUT :).\u201d Another asked, \u201cWhat is self-respect and ego in relationships?\u201d\nIn another post, Dr Velumani reflected on how workplace amenities have evolved since he started working nearly 60 years ago. He recalled how, in the 1980s, offices had no canteens. By the 1990s, they operated for only two hours a day. Over the decades, availability gradually expanded.\nHe humorously noted, \u201cLast week I visited an office. It is a 24x7 operating multicuisine food court. Pressures in offices too have similar growth?\u201d\nDr Arokiaswamy Velumani, born in 1959, is a self-made billionaire and a leader in the healthcare diagnostics industry. He founded Thyrocare Technologies, a pioneering company making diagnostic tests affordable in India. He also launched Nueclear Healthcare, specialising in advanced imaging and cancer diagnostics.\nWith a market capitalisation of Rs 7,000 crore in 2021, his journey from humble beginnings to building a billion-dollar company continues to inspire aspiring entrepreneurs.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "WORLD\nThe massive deposit, located beneath the soil of Folswiller in the Moselle region, is estimated to hold 46 million tonnes of hydrogen\nShivam Verma\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 09:01 AM IST\nFrance has made a big discovery in green energy with the largest known natural hydrogen reserve on the planet. The massive deposit, located beneath the soil of Folswiller in the Moselle region, is estimated to hold 46 million tonnes of hydrogen. According to reports, the value of this reserve is around $92 trillion, with expectations that its worth will rise in the future.\nThis discovery, made by researchers from the Georesources Laboratory and CNRS, was unexpected.\nScientists were originally searching for methane but instead found an enormous supply of white hydrogen buried 1,250 meters underground. This form of hydrogen is a potential game-changer as it provides a clean energy source without carbon emissions.\nUnlike green hydrogen, which requires electricity from renewable sources for production, or grey hydrogen, which is derived from fossil fuels and contributes to pollution, white hydrogen is naturally occurring. It is found deep underground and does not require complex industrial processes or generate harmful emissions.\nCurrently, the world\u2019s hydrogen economy faces challenges due to high production costs and dependency on fossil fuels. White hydrogen presents a cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative. If similar reserves are found elsewhere, it could spark a global shift toward sustainable energy.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "Donald Trump's AI head Sriram Krishnan\u2019s views on H1B visas, green cards",
        "ANALYSIS\nInterestingly, Sriram Krishnan has spoken in favour of expanding the H1B program and expediting the green card for individuals belonging to certain professions. He has also been in favour of removing the country cap on H1-B visas and Green cards.\nTridivesh Singh Maini\nUpdated : Dec 26, 2024, 04:56 PM IST\nIncoming US President Donald Trump recently appointed Sriram Krishnan as his Senior Advisor on Artificial Intelligence. Chennai born techie Sriram Krishnan has vast experience and has been a general partner of the American venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz since 2021. He began his career with Microsoft, after which he joined Facebook. Till 2019, Sriram Krishnan worked for Twitter (now X) and closely worked with Elon Musk who will be co-heading DOGE (Department for Government efficiency)\nWhile announcing his appointment, Trump in a post on X said:\n\u201cSriram Krishnan will serve as Senior Policy Advisor for Artificial Intelligence at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy\u2026Sriram will focus on ensuring continued American leadership in A.I., and help shape and coordinate A.I. policy across Government, including working with the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology\u201d\nIn his post, Trump also mentioned Krishnan\u2019s rich experience and the fact that he began his career with Microsoft.\nInterestingly, Sriram Krishnan has spoken in favour of expanding the H1B program and expediting the green card for individuals belonging to certain professions. He has also been in favour of removing the country cap on H1-B visas and Green cards.\nSeveral Trump supporters were critical of his appointment pointing to his stance on H1B and Green cards. Far-right American activist Laura Loomer said that Sriram Krishnan\u2019s views on immigration are diametrically opposite to those of Trump and go against the \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda of Donald Trump. She also dubbed the Indian origin entrepreneur as a \u201ccareer leftist\u201d.\nDavid Sacks, Incoming White House A.I. & Crypto Czar\u00a0 and Elon Musk came to Sriram Krishan\u2019s defense.\nSacks highlighted the point that Sriram Krishnan does not want to remove all caps, but country-based ones. Said Sacks\n\u201cSriram still supports skills-based criteria for receiving a green card, not making the program unlimited. He wants to make the program entirely merit-based\u201d..\nElon Musk also said that the criticism of Sriram Krishnan lacked merit and was based on the \u2018fixed-pie\u2019 fallacy. Said Musk in a post on X:\n\u201cThe \u2018fixed pie\u2019 fallacy is at the heart of much wrong-headed economic thinking. There is essentially infinite potential for job and company creation. Think of all the things that didn\u2019t exist 20 or 30 years ago!\u201d\nThe appointment of Sriram Krishnan points to the possible divide within the upcoming Trump administration regarding immigration policies.\nIt is not just Sriram Krishnan, even Elon Musk himself has repeatedly highlighted the fact that the US should be open to welcoming talented individuals who contribute towards the country\u2019s economy.\nHere it would be pertinent to point out that Trump himself has spoken about the need for US to welcome and retain talent. During an interview, the incoming president had said that international students who graduate from US colleges should be granted Green cards. It remains to be seen if Trump actually implements this proposal.\nIn conclusion, it remains to be seen if Trump and his team go ahead with some of the tough policy reforms pertaining to immigration while also focusing on retaining international students with skills and qualifications. There could be divisions in the upcoming administration on the issue of immigration. Certain members of his team would not be opposed to an immigration policy which is merit-based, while others may favour an approach which is driven more by political interests and aimed at appealing to certain constituencies. While course-corrections in the realm of immigration policies are taking place across the Anglosphere \u2013 UK, Canada and Australia \u2013 some changes under Trump 2.0 can not be ruled out. At the same time an excessively insular immigration policy which discourages students and professionals would be counter productive for the US.\n(Disclaimer: The views expressed above are the author's own and do not reflect those of DNA.)\n\r\n\tThe author is a policy analyst and faculty member at the Jindal School of International Affairs, OP Jindal Global University, Sonipat.\n\n\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

With the eagerly awaited title match set to occur in Dubai tomorrow, the authorities have finalized their decision on which strip will be used for the game on Sunday. The ground staff have carefully watered the entire square in preparation for the final and have decided to mark the center-wicket for the showdown between India and New Zealand. Interestingly, this is the same wicket that hosted the exciting India vs Pakistan clash during the group stage of the tournament.\nAccording to the Times of India, a previously used surface will be utilized for the Champions Trophy final.\nThe Emirates Cricket Board has followed its two-week rest policy for the pitches in Dubai, which recently hosted the ILT20 before India's matches in the Champions Trophy. However, due to certain circumstances, they had no option but to use a slightly worn surface for the final between India and New Zealand.\nThe pitch was last used on February 23 during the India vs Pakistan match and will now be employed once again on March 9 for the prestigious Champions Trophy final.\n\"The ILT20 was underway but the ground staff had an eye on the Champions Trophy. Not just the square, the outfield was given a lot of importance and that is why you have such a lush outfield even after so much cricket,\" adds the official.\nAs temperatures continue to soar in Dubai, the significance of spin bowling in the teams' strategies for the final match is becoming increasingly apparent. The center wicket has been shielded by covers in recent days, heightening anticipation for its unveiling.

        "BOLLYWOOD\nAfter Urvashi Rautela, Yami Gautam, and Pulkit Samrat-starrer Sanam Re was panned by critics and audiences in 2016, Divya Khosla Kumar has never directed a film in the last nine years.\nAman Wadhwa\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 02:20 PM IST | Edited by : Aman Wadhwa\nThe 2016 romantic drama Sanam Re, directed by Divya Khosla Kumar, was led by Pulkit Samrat, Yami Gautam, and Urvashi Rautela. One of the videos from the promotional interviews of the film has now resurfaced on social media, in which Urvashi is saying that she was the \"first\" to join the film, similar to her other \"first\" claims, and she is hilariously interrupted by Yami and Pulkit.\nTalking to Box Office India, Urvashi said, \"I was the first one to join the cast. That time the cast wasn\u2019t decided, who is going to play what.\" Yami interrupted and stated, \"That\u2019s what was told to everybody. We all were on board.\" Pulkit further jokingly added, \"Mujhse wo puch rahe the, Ye kaisi hai, ye kaisi hai (They were asking me. How is she? How is her as the heroine?).\nReacting to them, Urvashi added, \"So maybe she (Divya Khosla Kumar) kept it under wraps or whatever. So yeah, I signed that time. That\u2019s how it all started. A lot of people believe that I got it because of Love Dose, the song with Yo Yo Honey Singh, the international music video.\" Pulkit again interrupted and stated, \"You were so bad in that, Urvashi. How can you get it because of that?\". Urvashi stated, \"People do tell me that. I mean I signed this movie first. It somehow came later. That\u2019s how it happened. I have a very wonderful association with them. I did a song \u2018Daddy Mummy\u2019. I have 3 movie deal with them. This is the first film, and I am really excited about it. And Im also happy with the character which I am playing. It\u2019s a treat to work with her. She is an amazing director.\"\nA post shared by Bollywood ORRYginals (@thebollywoodorryginals)\nApart from Urvashi, Yami, and Pulkit, Sanam Re also featured Rishi Kapoor, Prachi Shah, Bharti Singh, and Manoj Joshi in key roles. Made in Rs 25 crore, Sanam Re earned Rs 27 crore net in India and grossed Rs 38 crore worldwide. The film was panned by the critics and audiences.

        "Bigg Boss 18 winner Karan Veer Mehra opens up on marriage plans with Chum Darang: 'She has a past, I have a past'",
        "TELEVISION\nKaran Veer Mehra and Chum Darang's relationship was one of the most discussed topics in the Salman Khan-hosted Bigg Boss 18.\nAman Wadhwa\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 03:20 PM IST | Edited by : Aman Wadhwa\nHosted by Salman Khan, the controversial reality show saw the two lovebirds Karan Veer Mehra and Chum Darang in the Grand Finale. While Chum ended as the fourth runner up, Karan went on to win the show. Even after Bigg Boss 18 ended in January, the two have taken forward their relationship forward and have been sharing their romantic photos on social media.\nThough Karan and Chum haven't officially confirmed their relationship status, they celebrated the Valentine's Day together in February. In a video shared by Chum from their dinner date, Karan even professed her love for her saying, \"Roses are red, Violets are blue, I don\u2019t care about anybody but I love you\", but they both laughed it off.\nNow, in his recent interview with Brut India, Karan was asked about his marriage plans with Chum and he replied, \"Now, I don't look nice while talking about marriage because people will get confused that I am getting married or cutting birthday cake every year. So, as Salman sir said the choice always lies with the girl.\"\nTalking about his relationship with Chum, he further added, \"With Chum and me right now, we are starting afresh. We are starting how we started in Bigg Boss, we are meeting, 'Hello, hi kaise ho?' because there are different tasks and different obstacles that we will go through in this Bigg Boss house (outside) which is abnormal. I call it abnormal, that (Bigg Boss) was normal. So, we are taking slow because she also has a past, I have a past. There are opinions here and there. There will be 100 messages and people saying something, so how do we cope with this is going to be our challenge right now.\"\nMeanwhile, Karan Veer Mehra has had two failed marriages. He was married to his childhood sweetheart Devika Mehra for nine years from 2009 to 2018. In 2021, he tied the knot again with actress Nidhi Seth and divorced her in 2023. In Bigg Boss 18, Chum Darang had stated that she was involved in a decade-long relationship with her ex boyfriend.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

In the post that has gone viral, the user said his father was an \"extremely qualified\" Physics educator.\n\"His only wish is to be respected which apparently is too much to ask for in private schools,\" the Redditor said.\nThe father holds an MSc degree from the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur and has over 30 years of teaching experience, according to the post.\n\"He married late and I'm young - still studying. I do work and do some freelance writing but it's not enough to support our family. Today, on a call with me, he broke down and told me how he's constantly berated and insulted at his workplace. He said he cannot take it anymore. I lost my mom a little over a year ago and I don't want to lose him too,\" the user shared.\n\"He's very knowledgeable and passionate about education and he does not deserve this.

        "Trump 2.0: Have you considered this? Achieving the 'Impossible' Together!",
        "WORLD\nKenny Holston of The New York Times via AP, Pool, quotes Trump as saying that his \u201cproudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier,\u201d as he continues his inaugural address.\nGirish Linganna\nUpdated : Jan 21, 2025, 01:13 PM IST\nDonald John Trump was sworn in as the 47th president of the United States on Monday. Soon after taking the oath as president, he said he was returning as the 47th president \u201cconfident and optimistic\u201d and that \u201ca thrilling new era of national success\u201d had begun. \u201cA tide of change is sweeping the country. Sunlight is pouring over the entire world, and America has the chance to seize this opportunity like never before.\u201d\n\u2018The rest of the world will envy us\u2019Trump vowed at his inaugural Address that he would end weaponization of the Justice Department and stated, \u201cThe scales of justice will be rebalanced. The vicious, violent and unfair weaponization of the Justice Department and government will end.\u201d\n\u2018I assure every American that I will always put \u2018America First\u2019, said Trump. \u201cThere will be sweeping changes, starting with the vicious weaponization of the Justice Department. From this moment on, America\u2019s decline globally is over\u2019.\nKenny Holston of The New York Times via AP, Pool, quotes Trump as saying that his \u201cproudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier,\u201d as he continues his inaugural address.\nHe said, \u201cLike in 2017, we will again build the strongest military the world has ever seen. We will measure our success not only by the battles we win, but also by the wars that we end. And, perhaps, most importantly, the wars we never get into.\u201d\nBut, making his first major announcement, the newly elected President of the United States (POTUS) declared a state of emergency on the southern border of Mexico, which received a standing ovation from all Republicans and a few swing-state Democrats, including Reps\u2014never mind 1960s singer Joan Baez\u2019s \u2018Jailhouse Trilogy\u2019\u2026\u201cLuna was a Mexican, the law called an alien,/ He came across the border with a baby and a wife\u2026\u201d. Trump, incidentally, announced that he would deport \u201cmillions and millions of criminal aliens\u201d.\nTrump wants to deport millions of people who live illegally in the US. However, he had already warned Mexico and other countries\u2014even Canada!\u2014of high tariffs and other penalties if they did not stop illegal immigrants from crossing the border.\nWhat Are Big Executive Orders?\nTrump is poised to pass several executive orders and directives on Day One in his second term as president related to matters ranging from energy to immigration, including declaring a national emergency at the US-Mexico border\u2014tackling such issues as immigration, energy, trade and social policies. Moreover, more than 200 additional directives are coming in the next few days. The orders are in tune with Trump\u2019s main campaign promises, including starting mass deportations and putting a lid on border security.\n\u201cI\u2019m pleased to say that, as of yesterday, one day before I assumed office, the hostages in the Middle East are coming back home to their families,\u201d Trump added to a standing ovation from those present. Israel\u2019s security Cabinet has approved a US-backed ceasefire deal with Hamas, which includes the release of hostages. The deal was delayed due to disputes with Hamas, but now it is moving forward\nThe Hamas-Israel ceasefire deal was mediated by Qatar and the US on Wednesday. However, Netanyahu said there were last-minute snags. But, in a significant move towards ending the 15-month-long war in Gaza, Israel\u2019s government, on Saturday, approved the ceasefire agreement with Hamas (effect on Sunday, January 19, including a series of hostage exchanges)\nGulf of Mexico Is Now \u2018Gulf of America\u2019\nTrump announced that he would rename the \u2018Gulf of Mexico\u2019 as the \u2018Gulf of America\u2019\nDefining National Energy Emergency\nOn the energy front, Trump plans to declare a national energy emergency with the will to promote \u2018affordable and reliable American energy\u2019. His campaign promise, \u2018Drill, Baby, drill\u2019, speaks a lot of this for hiking domestic energy production\nThe Issue of Energy Development in Alaska\nTrump will issue an EO making energy development in Alaska a top priority, emphasising the state\u2019s strategic importance to national security and its potential to become a key hub for LNG exports\nAdditionally, reports suggest Trump may withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement once again and take aim at policies supporting electric vehicles\nThe Issue of Trade and Tariffs\nMore actions may be imposing tariffs on global battery materials, rolling back environmental regulations and revoking California\u2019s stricter emissions standards. Trump has his trade agenda planned out\u2014clear and direct\u2014with his US agencies reviewing trade relationships with such countries as China, Canada and Mexico. The US has planned immediate new tariffs, but the review could lead to significant changes\nTrump has proposed tariffs of 10% on global imports\u2014that is 60% on Chinese goods and 25% on Canadian and Mexican products\u2014arguing these measures could spur US economic growth. Critics, however, warn that such moves may increase consumer costs\nViews On Transgengender Rights\nAs part of a series of executive orders, Trump plans to issue an order defining only two genders strictly as male and female, effectively ending policies that recognize transgender identities in federal government practices. Trump also intends to ban transgender individuals from serving in the military, being recognized in US schools and participating in women\u2019s sports\nPardons That Trump Expects to Give\nTrump plans to \u2018pardon\u2019 people who have been charged, or even convicted, for being involved in the Capitol attack on January 6, 2021\u2014a violent attack in which an unruly mob barged into the lawns of the Capitol to disrupt Congress\u2019s validation of the 2020 poll results. Trump wowed the crowd with so-called \u2018baseless\u2019 remarks of poll fraud at a rally earlier that day. However, he denied any responsibility for the violence that ensued.\nBy focusing on these sweeping changes across key policy areas, Trump\u2019s Administration aims to rapidly implement its agenda from Day One.\nAnd These Were Trump\u2019s Last Words\nAnd Trump\u2019s last words were that he wanted to send US astronauts to Mars. \u201c(We) will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars and plant the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars\u201d, he added.\n(The author of this article is an award-winning Science Writer and a Defence, Aerospace & Political Analyst based in Bengaluru.

        "Key changes and deadlines in March: What you need to know",
        "As the financial year draws to a close, individuals and investors must stay updated on changes and deadlines that take effect in March. From tax filings to UPI payment rules, here\u2019s what you need to know to make informed financial decisions.\nUpdated ITR (ITR-U) filing deadline | If you made errors in your previous Income Tax Return (ITR) or missed reporting income, you can still rectify it by filing an updated return (ITR-U). The deadline for filing an updated ITR for FY2022-23 is March 31, 2025. Missing this deadline means losing the opportunity to correct errors and report omitted income.\nTax-saving investments | For taxpayers, March 31, 2025, is the last date to invest and claim deductions. Key deductions under the Income Tax Act include: Section 80C: Investments in PPF, ELSS, NSC, and life insurance premiums (limit of \u20b91.5 lakh per year);\u00a0 Section 80D: Health insurance premium deductions; Section 24(b): Home loan interest deductions; NPS Contributions (80CCD(1B)): Additional \u20b950,000 deduction. Missing the deadline could result in higher tax liabilities for those following the old tax regime.\nUAN activation for EPFO members | Employees under the Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) must activate their Universal Account Number (UAN) by March 15, 2025, to avail of insurance benefits under the Employees\u2019 Deposit Linked Insurance (EDLI) scheme. The scheme offers insurance coverage of up to \u20b97 lakh for EPF members. If UAN activation is pending, members risk losing insurance benefits.\nNew nomination rules for mutual funds and demat accounts | Effective March 1, 2025 SEBI has revised nomination rules for mutual funds and demat accounts to ensure a smooth transfer of assets. Key changes include: Investors can nominate up to 10 individuals. Nomination is mandatory for single-holder accounts to prevent unclaimed assets. Required nominee details include PAN, last four digits of Aadhaar, or a driving license number. Investors must provide the nominee\u2019s contact details, relationship with the account holder, and date of birth (if the nominee is a minor). For joint accounts, assets will transfer automatically to the surviving account holder under the survivorship rule.\nUPI payment rule change for insurance premiums | UPI users will be able to pay insurance premiums using blocked amounts under the Bima-ASBA facility. This feature will ensure that policyholders' funds remain blocked until the insurer accepts the policy proposal. If the insurer rejects the proposal, the blocked amount will be automatically unblocked. This move will be available this month."

        "What is D-Remit in National Pension System?",
        "D-Remit, a crucial feature in the National Pension System (NPS), \u00a0allows subscribers to transfer funds from one NPS account to another seamlessly. This facility helps in simplifying the process for subscribers who wish to move their accumulated funds between different pension accounts. D-Remit is primarily designed for those who switch jobs, change locations, or opt for a different pension fund manager.\nSimplifying Fund Transfers for Subscribers\nD-Remit enables subscribers to seamlessly transfer their accumulated NPS funds without any disruptions. This eliminates the need for the traditional, cumbersome process that once required manual paperwork and involved multiple steps. The feature is intended to ensure continuity in retirement savings, which is crucial for individuals who frequently change jobs or relocate across the country.\nBenefits of D-Remit\nHow D-Remit Works\nUnder D-Remit, subscribers can request a transfer of funds from one NPS account to another through their current NPS account holder or the new account manager. This system reduces the complications involved in manual transfer requests and offers a more streamlined process. Subscribers simply need to initiate the transfer from their online account, making the process far more accessible and convenient.\nRole in NPS Growth and Accessibility\nD-Remit is seen as an important step towards increasing the flexibility and reach of NPS, especially for those working in the private sector or frequently moving across different geographical locations. By simplifying the transfer process, it encourages individuals to invest in NPS with more confidence, knowing that their retirement savings will not be hindered due to job or location changes.\nIn recent years, the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA)\u00a0has been working on several initiatives to make NPS more accessible, with D-Remit being one of the key steps in improving subscriber experience. The system is expected to make it easier for new and existing subscribers to stay enrolled in NPS, improving overall participation in the scheme."

        "Modi goes on Gir safari, spotlights Asiatic lion revival, and renews wildlife conservation pledge",
        "Prime Minister Narendra Modi took a lion safari at Gir Wildlife Sanctuary on World Wildlife Day, highlighting India's efforts to protect Asiatic lions and promote biodiversity conservation.\nModi Starts Safari: Prime Minister Narendra Modi kicked off a lion safari at Gir Wildlife Sanctuary in Gujarat on March 3, 2025, aligning with World Wildlife Day. His visit to the state included this special outing to spotlight conservation efforts. He started early Monday morning, driving through the sanctuary to observe its wildlife.\nSafari Location Details: The safari took place at Gir Wildlife Sanctuary, situated in Gujarat\u2019s Junagadh district, a region famous for its Asiatic lions. This sanctuary serves as a critical habitat for these animals, and Modi\u2019s visit aimed to raise awareness about their preservation.\nOfficials Join Tour: Modi was joined by several ministers and senior forest department officials during the jeep safari at Gir Wildlife Sanctuary. They travelled together through the rugged terrain, observing the lions in their natural environment. Modi took photographs of the animals, capturing their movements and surroundings.\nCommitment to Biodiversity: On World Wildlife Day, Modi renewed his promise to protect the planet\u2019s biodiversity, sharing his thoughts via a post on X. He wrote, \"Today, on #WorldWildlifeDay, let's reiterate our commitment to protect and preserve the incredible biodiversity of our planet.\" He also attached a video showcasing his previous jungle safaris.\nFocus on Species Role: Modi stressed the importance of every species in sustaining ecological balance, a point he made clear in his X post. He stated, \"Every species plays a vital role -- let's safeguard their future for generations to come!\" This call to action aimed to ensure wildlife thrives for years ahead. His words encouraged people to value all forms of life, linking their survival to the health of the planet.\nIndia\u2019s Conservation Efforts: Modi also praised India\u2019s work in wildlife protection during his World Wildlife Day statement. He wrote on X, \"We also take pride in India's contributions towards preserving and protecting wildlife.\" This highlighted national initiatives that have bolstered conservation across the country. He pointed to efforts like habitat restoration and species monitoring as examples of India\u2019s commitment.\nWildlife Board Meeting: At Sasan Gir, the administrative hub of Gir Wildlife Sanctuary, Modi chaired the seventh meeting of the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL) on 3 March 2025. This body, with 47 members, includes representatives from various states, NGOs, and the Chief of Army Staff. They gathered to review and plan strategies for wildlife conservation nationwide.\nProject Lion Explained: The central government introduced Project Lion to safeguard Asiatic lions, which live only in Gujarat. This initiative focuses on restoring lion habitats, engaging local communities in conservation, and advancing research on big cat diseases.\nLion Numbers Grow: The population of Asiatic lions in Gujarat has risen steadily, according to official counts. Numbers grew from 411 in 2010 to 523 in 2015, reaching 674 by June 2020. Their habitat expanded too, from 22,000 square kilometres in 2015 to 30,000 square kilometres in 2020.\nMeeting Forest Staff: After the NBWL meeting, Modi met with women forest staffers at Sasan on 3 March 2025. This took place following his lion safari and a review of Project Lion\u2019s progress. The interaction recognised the vital role these workers play in protecting the sanctuary\u2019s wildlife.\nTemple Prayers: On Sunday, 2 March 2025, Modi visited Somnath temple in Gujarat to offer prayers. This site, revered as the first of 12 Jyotirlingas, holds deep spiritual significance. After the visit, he travelled to Sasan and stayed overnight at Sinh Sadan, a forest guest house managed by the state."

        "The Lifestyle Of Chris Martin: Luxurious Cars, Lavish Mansions And No Dinner",
        "It was in 2016 that I heard the name \u2018Coldplay\u2019 for the first time when they were all set to perform in Mumbai. I belong to a tier-3 city in Odisha and still could get a sense of their popularity because of social media. Cut to 2025, I attended their concert in Mumbai and finally understood how a concert can actually \u2018change your life\u2019. No wonder they are arguably the most loved and popular bands in the world right now. With all the excellence and magic they have created, success has inevitably followed them, in terms of money and fame.\nWhile all the band members have equal contribution in making the band what it is today, the fans feel a special connection with the lead singer Chris Martin. Being the frontperson, he constantly interacts with the crowd and his charm and kindness is infectious. Chris is said to have a net worth of $160 million (\u20b9 1,382 Cr), while the other band members Guy, Will, and Jonny have an estimated net worth is $100 million each.\nOwing to his luxurious lifestyle, Chris reportedly owns a Jeep Wrangler JK, which typically costs around \u20b9 70 lakh.\nIn addition to this, he also is said to own a 1966 Shelby 350GT.\nMartin owns multiple luxurious properties in Malibu and London. According to Realtor.com and Benzinga, Chris purchased a Cape Cod-style mansion in Malibu for $12.5 million (\u20b9 108 Cr) in 2020. However, after just a year he sold it for  $14.4 million (\u20b9 124 Cr). With five bedrooms, seven bathrooms, a two-story, two-bedroom guesthouse, a game room, home theater, high-end kitchen, this house surely was one from the dreamlands.\nHis another house at Malibu was bought in 2018 with $4.5 million (\u20b9 38 Cr). This establishment earlier used to be the iconic Malibu Playhouse. Spanning 6.5 acres, it has a hexagonal structure and a wellness retreat, horse facility, and recording studio.\nAccording to\u00a0The Standard, Chris had purchased a $5,475,000 (\u20b9 47 Cr) 60s ranch house in Point Dume.  The 1,800-square-foot layout has a designer kitchen, heated flooring, floor-to-ceiling glass slider openings and a pretty garden with a koi pond.\nBeing a global superstar and performing all over the world, Chris always stays on a strict diet. In a podcast with Conan O\u2019Brien, Chris revealed that he had stop having dinner after his lunch with one of his heroes Bruce Springsteen. Bruce seemed fitter than Chris despite being nearly twice of his age. After learning that Bruce only took one meal a day, Chris adapted the same formula as his next challenge. Now he doesn\u2019t have food post 4 PM.\nAnd after all this, Chris has Dakota as his partner. Bro can\u2019t win more than this in life."

        "The famous saying \u201cdil walon ki dilli\u201d just got real when the Internet discovered a gem at the heart of the \u2018city! In a world where people are charged heavily for even the bare minimum facilities, airports charge extraordinary prices for a cup of coffee and corporations are capitalizing on last-minute convenience needs and earning millions, this cab driver is offering more facilities than a flight. But that\u2019s not it \u2013 everything that you will see in his car is absolutely free!\nIn a recent Reddit post on r/Delhi, a user shared his experience when he boarded a cab that looked no less than a convenience store. Comparing it with flights, he captioned the above image with \u201cFound cab facilities better than flights\u2026\u201d and soon the post gained attraction with more than 7k likes and users sharing their own experiences with this generous driver.\nThe comments also identified the driver as Abdul Qadir, who has been covered by newspapers as the \u201cUber driver who\u2019s never cancelled on his customers\u201d. As per The Economic Times, Abdul is a 50+ years old driver who has gone above and beyond with his facilities, giving his customers a unique experience. He has converted his car into a mobile store with almost every facility. Starting from cold drinks, munchies, snacks, and candies to bottled mineral water, umbrellas, and tissue paper, he has a very thoughtful collection of complimentary goodies.\nBut that isn\u2019t just it. He also offers a variety of medications like Dolo, Digene, Disperin, Citrazine, and others for emergency purposes. Along with that, he also stocks safety pins, shoe polish, toothpaste, powder, masks, ashtray, and newspapers. One cannot stop and think about all the thoughts he put into making a ride memorable for a passenger he will only meet once.\nRevealing the reason why he decided to go to extra lengths for his customers, Abdul shared that he met a student at the New Delhi Railway Station during his usual day. But the student made multiple stops to prepare for an interview which made Abdul realize how much his passengers would benefit if he stocked up daily essentials.\nImpressed by his hospitality, Reddit users shared their opinions in the thread, which has now gone viral.\nManifesting to get Abdul Qadri ji as my next Uber ride!"

        "13 Tweets To Read Before Streaming \u2018Black Warrant\u2019 On Netflix",
        "After a not-so-great year for the Indian OTT space in 2024, the new year starts with a promising new show. Created by Vikramaditya Motwane and Satyanshu Singh, Black Warrant has dropped on Netflix and the internet can\u2019t stop raving about it.\nThe show tells the stories from arguably the best-known prison in the country \u2013 Tihar jail. It is based on the book Black Warrant: Confessions of a Tihar Jailer, co-written by the former jailer of Tihar, Sunil Gupta. In its bold and harrowing revelations, Black Warrant presents the controversial procedural lapses and the corruption that existed in the legal and judicial system.\nIn telling the stories of real-life infamous criminals like Charles Sobhraj and Ranga-Billa, the show eerily reminded me of the show Mindhunter (of course, if it was set inside an Indian jail with all its travesty and corruption). Here\u2019s a glimpse into what Twitter has to say about the show starring Zahan Kapoor as Sunil Gupta, Rahul Bhat, Paramvir Singh Cheema, Anurag Thakur among others.\nAfter the peak era of web shows 4-5 years ago, Black Warrant is easily one of the best I've seen in a long time. pic.twitter.com/f841dB2buX\nBlack Warrant On Netflix Is Highly Recommended. pic.twitter.com/xIoUSEXLfn\nBlack Warrant is @NetflixIndia \u2018s best original series since Sacred Games season 1. Wow!! Vikramaditya Motwane is a genius who simply never misses. pic.twitter.com/Oe1bxG2Bsj\nTwo years ago, the book hooked me instantly. Now on Netflix, Black Warrant is immersive, detailed, and brilliantly acted.\npleased to announce that black warrant fkin slaps. a long format victory we haven't seen in agesgod bless vikram motwane & team. pic.twitter.com/xTNNDMgrNp\nShashi Kapoor would have been immensely proud. A star is born! #ZahanKapoor pic.twitter.com/Tq70yj4NPX\n6 min into #BlackWarrant and bbgorl Siddhant Gupta shows up as Charles Sobhraj?? So many unholy thoughts in my head istg \ud83e\udee6 pic.twitter.com/gEhqMggbCr\nBlack warrant was fantastic.. thoroughly enjoyed it. Stories so fascinating i went and searched more about all the people hanged lol. Do watch the series! Zahan makes impressive debut, Rahul as usual owns every scene he is in. Terrific performer. #BlackWarrant pic.twitter.com/uhjUIf6YMB\n#BlackWarrant was good. Liked Motwane's adaption. The visuals are so good, one of those shows where not a single performance is off. Zahan Kapoor, smashing debut this. pic.twitter.com/buDgKTnwV9\nBlack warrant is a must watch. Return of Bingeable Indian content on Netflix finally and that too by Motwane.\nthe ranga billa episode of Black Warrant is harrowing..masterful\nNetflix finally has a winner in #BlackWarrant. The 2nd episode directed by Vikram Motwane is the one to watch out for & how I wish he directed it all not just 3 eps but probably as creator you have to give chance to other directors too.Little dark,gripping & fantastically done. pic.twitter.com/sD4e3sOYXq\nblack warrant had me shocked to figure out zahaan is from the Kapoor family \u2014 so unassuming and what a fantastic actor\nAfter so long, an Indian OTT show has garnered universal acclaim and love. With shows like Black Warrant, we hope this year becomes a great one for us, the viewers, and the filmmakers."

        "In a shocking turn of events, Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan was injured during a late-night burglary incident at his residence in Bandra. The attack occurred during the early hours of 16 January, when an intruder entered his home and confronted one of the domestic staff. Attempting to step in, Mr. Khan was stabbed multiple times, which includes injuries near his spine.\nThe actor was rushed to Lilavati Hospital, where an emergency surgery was performed to remove the knife fragments. Hospital officials have confirmed that Khan is now stable, moved out of the ICU and is recovering under medical care. The intruder fled the scene, however, and authorities are currently investigating the same. Here\u2019s a complete update on the case.\nAt 2:30 am, Saif Ali Khan was resting with his wife Kareena Kapoor Khan, and two young sons Jeh and Taimur when he heard noise in Jeh\u2019s bedroom. The 56-year-old nanny, Eliyamma Philip alias Lima was the sole witness to the attack and sustained injuries on her right wrist during the fight. She was brought to Bandra police station for further investigation. Describing the incident, she said, \u201cWhen I tried to see who was there, I saw a person coming out of the bathroom and moving towards Jeh Baba\u2019s (Jehangir\u2019s) bed\u201d. She rushed towards Jeh to rescue him, while the armed intruder threatened her not to make noise and give him 1 crore rupees. Saif heard the scuffle and entered the room and the attacker attacked him. When Saif sir came, the accused attacked him with the Hexa blade and then also attacked Geeta (Taimur\u2019s nanny), who had also come and tried to intervene,\u201d Philip said.\nAs per reports, the actor and his nanny Geeta temporarily subdued the attacker and locked him in the room before going to another floor. However, upon returning, they found the room to be empty.\nThe knife hit Mr. Khan\u2019s back, just one millimeter away from his spine, and was rushed to the Lilavati Hospital by his son Ibrahim Ali Khan at 3:30 am. The hospital confirmed to The Indian Express that Saif Ali Khan had sustained six wounds in total. As per Indian Express, \u201cTwo are deep cuts, primarily on his back, with one located near the spine. A minor wound is present on his neck, while the remaining injuries are superficial. The neurosurgery has been completed, and doctors are now proceeding with plastic surgery\u201d. The actor was operated by a team of doctors which included a neurosurgeon and a cosmetic surgeon. The doctors also revealed that if the knife had been a millimeter deep, it would have resulted in saline fluid leakage and put the actor\u2019s life at immense risk.  Dr. Nitin Dange, the neurosurgeon leading the spinal surgery, said, \u201cThe knife, lodged in the thoracic spine, caused a major injury, including a leak in the spinal fluid. We successfully removed the foreign object and repaired the spinal damage to prevent further complications. It was a delicate operation, requiring coordinated efforts from our team,\u201d he stated.\nDr. Niraj Uttamani, Chief Operating Officer of Lilavati Hospital, said, \u201cKhan\u2019s injuries, while severe, were expertly managed by our team.\u201d The actor is currently moved out of the ICU to a special room and recovering steadily.  Out of danger now, he is likely to be discharged in two days.\nDCP Dixit Gedam has confirmed that an FIR has been officially registered against the accused carrying grave non-bailable charges like Section 311, 312, 331(7), and others. The police have deployed ten teams, alongside five specialized crime branch units to investigate Bandra and nearby hotspots. Forensic teams have collected the evidence from Saif\u2019s home and building to track down the attacker. Along with that, the police have also released CCTV images capturing the intruder on the sixth floor of Saif\u2019s house which was last spotted in Prabhadevi.\nThe intruder entered the building using a second entrance which wasn\u2019t high and had a tear on its net, leading to a suspect that an insider facilitated the theft. He used the shaft as he was not spotted using the lifts or lobby. The police have currently detained a suspect at the Bandra police station this morning. However, no arrests have been made till the time of writing\nIn an Instagram post, Kareena Kapoor Khan requested privacy regarding the unfortunate events. Writing on her Instagram story, she shared, \u201cIt has been an incredibly challenging day for our family, and we are still trying to process the events that have unfolded. As we navigate this difficult time, I respectfully and humbly request that the media and paparazzi refrain from the relentless speculation and coverage\u201d.\n\u201cWhile we appreciate the concern and support, the constant scrutiny and attention are not only overwhelming but also pose a significant risk to our safety. I kindly request that you respect our boundaries and give us the space we need to heal and cope as a family. I would like to thank you in advance for your understanding and cooperation during this sensitive time.\u201d she wrote.\nThe actor was paid a visit by many stars and friends including Ranbir Kapoor, Alia Bhatt, Malaika Arora, Karan Johar, Amrita Arora, and Arjun Kapoor. Many of them wished him a speedy recovery on social media. The incident also raised concerns about the safety among the elite neighbourhoods of Mumbai, especially after the constant threats to Salman Khan and killing of Baba Siddique.\n"

        "Mark Zuckerberg Predicts This Device Will Replace Phones & It Sounds Like a Sci-Fi-Movie Scene",
        "While the world is yet adjusting to smartphones and their updating technologies, Mark Zuckerberg has shared his scary prediction about the end of smartphones. His bold anticipation of smartphones coming to an end has created significant buzz in the tech industry. But more than that, his idea of what will replace mobile phones is even more thrilling (and scary).\nIn the latest episode with Joe Rogan, an American podcaster, comedian, actor, and former television host on his podcast platform, The Joe Rogan Experience, Zuckerberg spoke about Meta\u2019s Orion augmented reality glasses and how smart glasses will change our way of interacting. Sharing his ideas, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to have glasses, and we\u2019re going to be able to be here, and I\u2019m going to be able to, you know, text my wife or friends or something. Or text AI and get an answer to something. Like, if I forgot something while we were talking, I could just text AI \u2013 okay, I just did that. You\u2019re just sitting there, totally discreet, with glasses, and the answer just comes to you\u201d.\nTalking to Joe, he explained how smartphones limit interactions, saying, \u201cWe have our phones, but, you know, it\u2019s like they take you away from the physical environment around you. You\u2019re kind of sucked into this little screen. I think in the future, as our computing platforms evolve into more of a glasses or even contact lens form factor, the internet will get overlaid onto the physical world. It won\u2019t be like we have the physical world and then all our digital stuff through this tiny little window. Instead, all your attention will stay on the world, where the physical and virtual elements are seamlessly overlaid together.\u201d\nIt isn\u2019t the first time Meta CEO has admired the technology behind smart glasses and predicted the end of smartphones. Zuckerberg has reportedly predicted that within the next decade, smartphones will be taken over by smart glasses in terms of popularity and practicality. In a past podcast with Cleo Abram, Mark Zuckerberg stated that AR glasses can be the next major platform after phones.\nHonestly, this might seem a little far-fetched but so was the idea of smartphones and video-calling to our parents back in the 90s. Neither of them thought that we could talk to our loved ones no matter where they were sitting. Technology is upgrading itself each day and the new future is here in the form of glasses. I remember seeing Tony Stark and Devi Lal Singh (Kick) using their hands in the air to build their ideas, I believe it wouldn\u2019t be very far that I can see people in the streets doing the same, wearing AR Glasses. And let\u2019s not forget, VR Headsets are already here.\nWhile some of us may not be the early adopters of technology, chances are we will soon see it around us and in the next few decades even use it actively. It will make technology more accessible, seamless, and well-integrated into our daily lives \u2013 just by wearing it. There will be hands-free interaction, real-time information, and immersive gaming and entertainment experiences.\nHonestly, to me, it sounds a little scary to let go of my smartphone and get a pair of glasses to do the same. It will also mean that these glasses will have even more access to my daily life and activities, thus increasing the risk of privacy and intrusion. It will reduce face-to-face interactions and instead increase isolation, cognitive overload, social awkwardness and detachment, something that we are already struggling to solve with smartphones. Along with that, it also hints towards addiction, 24/7 connectivity to the internet, and the digital divide due to its initial costs.\nWell, looks like the future won\u2019t remain in our pockets anymore."

        "Two Wheels, One Epic Adventure: A Breathtaking Ride Through Northeast India",
        "Adventure has always been my calling, and my love for off-roading recently took me on an unforgettable journey to Northeast India. Riding my brand-new Royal Enfield Himalayan 450, I embarked on a 14-day expedition with 25 complete strangers, all from different walks of life. It felt like a real-life Roadies experience, minus the drama and the vote-outs!\nAs I navigated the breathtaking trails of the Northeast, my bike proved to be the perfect companion. The powerful pick-up and smooth handling made even the toughest off-road terrains feel like a knife slicing through butter. This magical adventure kicked off in Guwahati, Assam, known as the Gateway to the Northeast. Little did I know, the journey ahead would be one of the most exhilarating rides of my life.\nRiding into Cherrapunji from Guwahati on my bike, a wave of nostalgia hit me. Suddenly, all those geography lessons from school came rushing back, about Cherrapunji being the wettest place on Earth (now the second). And true to its reputation, Meghalaya lived up to its name, which means \u201cthe abode of clouds\u201d.\nThe weather was as unpredictable as the journey itself. One moment, I was drenched in sweat from the humid heat, and the next, the clouds soaked us completely with rain. But that\u2019s the magic of Meghalaya \u2013 you don\u2019t just see the beauty, you feel it. After getting lost in the magic of Meghalaya we headed back to Shillong to enjoy local delicacies like a traditional rice dish called jadoh, barbeque pork, etc. And then, we explored the bustling Police Bazaar for shopping.\nThe next day\u2019s ride was smooth and effortless, thanks to my trusty Himalayan 450. Our destination? The Living Root Bridge \u2013 a bridge not built by humans but grown by nature itself. The roots of ancient trees have intertwined over time, forming a sturdy connection across the river. Walking across it felt surreal, as if stepping onto a masterpiece crafted by nature\u2019s own hands.\nIt was time to head back to Assam and explore its wildlife wonders. Leaving the mountains behind, we hit the open plains, and riding at 150 km/h on a straight highway, I had a realisation, if the bike was the beast, then I was the beauty, and this beast had my back. Reaching Kaziranga National Park, we set out on a safari, and to my shock, the first animal I spotted was a freaking tiger! Watching it move gracefully from a safe distance was a dream come true for a cat lover like me. As we explored further, we encountered the majestic one-horned rhino, deer, monitor lizards, wild buffalo, and more.\nOur next stop was Majuli, a unique island in the middle of the Brahmaputra River. Getting there was an adventure in itself, we rode to the ferry point, carefully loaded our bikes onto the ferry, and set off towards the island. Once we arrived, we were welcomed with the vibrant Bihu dance and got a taste of their local rice beer, Apong. And let me tell you \u2013 it was one hell of an experience!\nThis was something I had been most excited about,- heading to Ziro in Arunachal Pradesh. It was my first time there, and every second was worth it! The lush greenery, the cool temperature, the warm people, and even the surprisingly cheap alcohol (cheaper than Goa!) made it an unforgettable experience. We visited the Apatani Tribe\u2019s homes and their paddy fields, where elderly Apatani women sang and danced in their local language called Tani. I had always wanted to visit Ziro for its famous music festival, but this was something else: peaceful, grounding, and deeply soulful.\nOn Day 7, we took a pit stop at Nameri National Park before heading to Dirang, as it was a long journey. But what awaited us on Day 8 was truly something special.\nThis ride to Dirang was where we witnessed the real beauty of Arunachal Pradesh, spotting Mithuns (large domestic cattle) and yaks casually roaming around, animals you don\u2019t get to see in everyday life. The most surreal part? Riding through the clouds, feeling the cool moisture and the gentle rain they carried.\nThis was by far one of the most adventurous rides of the entire trip. After crossing the Sela Tunnel, we witnessed a frozen waterfall, a sight straight out of a dream. But while I once thought my boss was my biggest enemy, I quickly realized the real one was black ice, making the ride dangerously slippery. Thankfully, my bike made it easier as its suspension and tire grip gave me the confidence to push through safely. Reaching Tawang was a spiritual experience, and I felt incredibly lucky to be there during the festival season.\nAfter Tawang, we wrapped up our journey, heading back to Guwahati. And let me tell you, throughout this entire trip, it was my bike that gave me the confidence to ride through it all. Now, I truly understand why people fall in love with their bikes.\n\n\u2b50Awesome"

        "Podcast Host\u2019s Rant About North Indian Tourists In Vietnam Has The Internet Screaming \u2018Stereotype Alert\u2019",
        "A podcast host has stirred the pot on social media after sharing his less-than-pleasant encounters with North Indian tourists during his New Year trip to Vietnam.\nRavi Handa, the host of Desi FIRE Podcast, accused them of \u201cruining\u201d his travel experience, sparking a flurry of reactions online.\nRavi Handa kicked off the conversation by explaining why he skipped Goa for his New Year\u2019s getaway. \u201cGoa has too many North Indian tourists, and they ruin the experience,\u201d he said, choosing Vietnam instead. But to his dismay, he encountered what he described as \u201cbad behaviour\u201d from Indian tourists there as well.\nI went to Vietnam for the new year break, and Goa was a choice. But not for the reasons any of you people on twitter go bonkers about. Goa has too many North Indian tourists and they ruin the experience. Even in Vietnam, the only bad behavior was from North Indian tourists.\u2026 https://t.co/CHiZeVRgoT\nFrom cutting lines with excuses like \u201cHum logon ke pass special pass hai\u201d to shouting Bharat Mata Ki Jai in a crowded train, Handa claimed the loud antics were mostly from North Indians. \u201cI even stopped one at the cable car line,\u201d he added, \u201cbut arguing seemed pointless.\u201d\nNaturally, Twitter took sides faster than a tea-seller at an Indo-Pak match. Many users lashed out at Handa for stereotyping North Indians, calling his remarks \u201cracist.\u201d\n\u201cHow did you know they were North Indians?\u201d asked one user, to which Handa replied that the tourists explicitly mentioned being from NCR. Another user pointed out, \u201cThis mentality of dividing North, South, East, and West is why we can\u2019t progress as a society.\u201d\nUber racist comment \ud83e\udd2eHow did you know that misbehaving tourists were North India?You can tell everything about a person by looking at him \ud83e\udd2d\nWhile Handa\u2019s comments did raise eyebrows, they also found some support. Many North Indians chimed in, admitting they\u2019ve witnessed similar behaviour. \u201cMe, being a North Indian myself, always felt ashamed, but now it\u2019s a whole new level of shame!\u201d wrote one user.\nYep. We have to agree that we Indians don't have civics sense (including me). We need to improve. And more people coming out on SM is one such way to nudge us to improve.\nAnother added, \u201cThere was a group of North Indians on a train in Europe, making too much noise in the name of \u2018having a good time.\u2019 All the other Europeans were silent, and only these people were shouting.\u201d\nThe debate has reignited conversations about travel etiquette and the stereotypes associated with Indian tourists abroad. While some argue that bad behaviour knows no region, others believe it\u2019s time to introspect and, well, turn the volume down a notch.\nSo, what do you think? Are these stereotypes justified, or are we simply dividing ourselves further? Let us know in the comments, but, you know, quietly."

        "After all the rush and hype, Coldplay is finally in India! The Grammy-winning band has completed its first leg of the tour in Mumbai on January 18, 19, and 21, performing at DY Patil Stadium. Their return to India was nothing less than spectacular after a gap of 9 years, leaving all their fans mesmerized. Mumbai, the city that never sleeps, was buzzing like never before.

        "Here\u2019s How Much People In My Office Are Spending On Quick Commerce Apps and I Feel Like A Noob!",
        "A few days back, I shared my experience on the internet about how I spent 30k on online delivery apps in the span of 8 months and how the apps made me lazier than I was since everything was at my fingertips. I tried to point out how subconsciously these apps and their instant gratification have changed our consumption patterns so much, that we are prioritizing quick delivery over health. The internet\u2019s reaction was very interesting. Some of them were very quick to point out that convenience wasn\u2019t the problem, but my laziness and bad habits were (as if I didn\u2019t know).\nA post shared by Instagram (@instagram)\nHowever, some of them commented that my numbers were \u201crookie\u201d and that I needed to bump them up! Well, that got me thinking \u2013 how much are people actually spending on these online delivery apps? And I decided to go on a little survey in my office and it turns out, people are spending a considerable amount of money that I couldn\u2019t even have thought of.\nDuring the survey, I asked them to add all the money that they have spent on quick commerce apps like Zomato, Swiggy, Blinkit, BigBasket, Zepto, or anything that they used for groceries and supplies for the month of December. Most of them relied on these apps for groceries, but when they calculated, they themselves were shocked at how much they actually spent even if it was on essentials. Some of them agreed that it promoted unhealthy habits and they might get it cheaper if they purchased it at local stores. Take a look for yourself:\nWell, for sure I am a noob when it comes to these online spending patterns.\nPlease note that these numbers are a representation of how dependent the respondents are on these online apps and don\u2019t reveal their eating habits or ordering patterns."

        "Netizens Share Price Differences On Delivery Apps For iOS & Android And We Are Shocked!",
        "Delivery apps are a lifeline for many of us, especially those with the busiest schedules. Whether you forget someone\u2019s gift, want groceries, or need midnight snacks, these delivery apps have made everything just one click away. However, this world of convenience isn\u2019t as perfect as it seems. As more and more users are now adopting this quick commerce lifestyle, they can\u2019t help but notice some particular patterns \u2013 which are not ethical per se.\nWell, if you have ever compared notes with your friends and realized that your groceries or delivery bills on these apps don\u2019t really match, you are not alone. Recently a lot of netizens have shared their experiences on social media platforms about dark patterns that these apps have adopted. But a particular one in highlight is the price difference for iOS and Android. Users have spotted slightly (and sometimes considerably high) prices of the same groceries when ordered from the same location at the same time. The only difference is their phone model.\nThis has resulted in a lot of questions, including \u2013 are apps charging us differently based on the device we use? Because it looks like they are. Recently, Vinita Singh from LinkedIn shared her experience when she discovered that capsicums were priced at a huge difference on Zepto for an Android and iOS phone.\nThe Android phone showed the difference to be Rs. 21, whereas the iPhone showed it to be almost Rs. 107. A whopping difference of Rs. 86. The users shared their experiences in the comment section. While one user commented \u201ciPhone leke ghumte ho kharcha to hoga na\u201d, one user justified the difference as: \u201c(more)\u2026.. Apple is charging $965 more than Google to keep your app published. So, companies have to find a way to manage this cost, and I guess the users, for whom companies need to pay this amount, should be the best source to manage this extra cost.\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t just an isolated incident. Multiple users have complained about the dynamic pricing between iPhone and Android users. Take a look:\nHey @ZeptoNow , I understand that I\u2019m using an iPhone, but that doesn\u2019t mean I can afford to pay more than Android users for the same product. We\u2019ve already paid our taxes please don\u2019t loot us again @jagograhakjago @BandBajaateRaho pic.twitter.com/IUfW3lP83v\nAndroid vs iPhone comparison Same Location, Same Product App : Zepto @ZeptoNow Paneer on Android : \u20b9 116Paneer on iPhone : \u20b9 139Soyarich Tofu on Android : \u20b9 59Soyarich Tofu on iPhone : \u20b9 75Why this much difference for many products? #Zepto #ZeptoNow 1/2.. pic.twitter.com/sNwHUXTCOC\nPrice difference in iPhone and Android.

This one is a bit tricky:\u2013 They have stopped showing the amount total effective price breakdown\u2013 Discounted prices of goods added don\u2019t match up to the totalcontinued \ud83d\udd3b pic.twitter.com/BlCKNVvhTY\nWell, it isn\u2019t just online delivery apps, but other service-based apps like Uber as well. Users have shared how Uber has also presented dynamic planning for different models of phones.\nSame pickup point, destination & time but 2 different phones get 2 different rates. It happens with me as I always get higher rates on my Uber as compared to my daughter\u2019s phone. So most of the time, I request her to book my Uber. Does this happen with you also? What is the hack? pic.twitter.com/bFqMT0zZpW\n@Uber_India  what logic you use to price your rides is obviously out of my understanding. Could you care to explain for us?Same spot, same time, same distance but different phone and price difference is 110Rs.WHY??#Bengaluru pic.twitter.com/uv7J0IbnLJ\n@Uber_India what are you guys smoking?This is the fare difference between a oneplus 11r and iPhone 14.Android is showing more price?? Any reason? pic.twitter.com/v5L9S9oP70\nThe next time you open your favorite quick commerce app, take a moment to consider what\u2019s happening behind the scenes. Are you paying a premium because of your phone? Is the app quietly tweaking fees based on assumptions about your spending habits?\nWhile these price differences may seem small, they raise bigger questions about fairness, transparency, and how much control we really have as consumers."

        "Jagdeep Singh\u2019s \u20b948 Crore/Day Salary Is Blowing Minds, But His Journey Is Even Wilder",
        "Ever wondered what it\u2019s like to earn \u20b948 crore every single day? Well, that\u2019s just a regular day in the life of Jagdeep Singh, the founder and former CEO of Quantumscape.\nWith an annual salary of \u20b917,500 crore, Singh holds the title of the highest-paid employee in the world. But beyond the jaw-dropping numbers, his story is one of relentless ambition, innovation, and the unstoppable rise of the EV industry.\nJagdeep Singh\u2019s journey is anything but ordinary. Armed with a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Computer Science from the University of Maryland, a Master\u2019s from Stanford University, and an MBA from UC Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business, Singh laid the groundwork for a career destined for greatness.\nBefore Quantumscape, Singh cut his teeth at tech giants like Sun Microsystems and Ciena, gaining the experience that would later fuel his entrepreneurial ventures. From co-founding AirSoft to launching Infinera, Singh\u2019s career has been a masterclass in chasing the future before it arrives.\nIn 2010, Singh\u2019s career took a pivotal turn when he recognized the untapped potential of battery technology in transforming the electric vehicle industry. Enter Quantumscape, a company now leading the charge in revolutionizing EV battery innovation.\nBacked by heavyweights like Volkswagen and Bill Gates, Quantumscape became a beacon of the EV industry, pushing boundaries and delivering cutting-edge tech that\u2019s shaping the cars of tomorrow. Singh\u2019s visionary leadership didn\u2019t just make Quantumscape a success; it made him the highest-paid employee globally.\nSingh\u2019s record-breaking compensation package wasn\u2019t just handed over on a silver platter. It was tied to ambitious performance goals, a bold, multi-billion-dollar deal that reflected the immense value he brought to Quantumscape. It wasn\u2019t just about running a company; it was about transforming an industry.\nEven after stepping down as CEO in 2024, Singh\u2019s drive hasn\u2019t slowed down. Now the CEO of a stealth startup (because apparently, the EV industry wasn\u2019t enough), he\u2019s already working on disrupting new sectors.\nSo, the next time you need a little inspiration (or a reminder to update your LinkedIn profile), just think about the man who went from coding in classrooms to redefining industries, and earning \u20b948 crore a day while at it. Now, that\u2019s some real career goals!\n"

        "As TikTok Ban Intensifies World Over, This App Can Become The Next Big Thing",
        "The digital world is a fast-moving beast, and if there\u2019s one thing we\u2019ve learned in recent years, it\u2019s that people\u2019s obsession with social media knows no bounds. The minute something becomes outdated, it\u2019s replaced\u2014sometimes in a flash. The latest victim of this relentless cycle is TikTok, a platform that, just a few days ago, boasted a massive following of 170 million users in the United States.\nBut with a looming US ban on the horizon, many TikTokers, also referred to as \u201cTikTok Refugees\u201d, are packing up and heading to this new Chinese app, RedNote (also known as Xiaohongshu in China). And guess what? It\u2019s taking over big and fast. The app saw almost 3 million users registering in one day!\nAmericans are currently facing a digital crisis as there are reports that TikTok will shut down its operations in the country after a federal ban was imposed on the Chinese company during Biden\u2019s rule. ByteDance had nine months to find a US-approved buyer or risk closure under a bipartisan law signed by President Joe Biden and ratified by Congress in April 2024. Described as, \u201ca national-security threat of immense depth and scale,\u201d by the US Justice Department, ByteDance faced allegations of giving up user data belonging to Americans to the Chinese government. TikTok and ByteDance vehemently refuse this accusation.\nThe method of collecting data, data privacy, and algorithmic content delivery were the staggering points of concern for the US government as it was used by almost 170 million users in America. But even before America found the security implications of the application on privacy and security, many other governments had banned the app, including India.\nHowever, the irony is undeniable as users moved on to another Chinese-language app, RedNote as the replacement for TikTok. Within just a couple of days, RedNote skyrocketed to the top of app store download charts. The app was already seeing a rise in popularity with about 3.4 million daily active users in the US on January 15. Just the day before, that number was a mere 700,000. It\u2019s clear \u2013 Americans were in full crisis mode, searching for something to fill the void TikTok was about to leave behind.\nThe app, initially built to be a lifestyle and e-commerce platform in China, serves as a kind of mix between Instagram and Pinterest, with a heavy focus on sharing content like lifestyle tips, fashion, beauty, food, and travel. It\u2019s got all the elements people crave when they\u2019re looking to kill time: pretty pictures, fun trends, short-form videos, and the virality of TikTok. It has a built-in e-commerce platform that allows users to shop directly. As per reports, Shanghai-based Xingyin Information Technology Co., Ltd. is the owner of RedNote. Thus, in a technical sense, the Chinese government does not own it. However, Chinese legislation gives the government extensive control over every aspect of business activities.\nWhat\u2019s fascinating about this sudden surge is not just the rise of a new app but the clear reflection of social media addiction. Here\u2019s the thing: Social media is no more just a time-filler; it\u2019s a part of life or sometimes, the whole life of a person. People go to these platforms to escape, to entertain themselves, and sometimes, to find community or validation. It\u2019s become such a deep part of daily life that even the thought of losing access to it \u2013 like the possibility of TikTok being banned, sparks near-panic among millions of users. Just like TikTok Refugees flooding to RedNote.\nIn this case, RedNote is the beneficiary of TikTok\u2019s downfall, but who knows? If RedNote faces its own issues in the future, another platform will likely be waiting in the wings. The digital world is full of these cycles\u2014rising, falling, and being replaced at the speed of light. RedNote is taking over, and it might very well be the next big thing in social media in the US But the larger question remains: How long before this cycle repeats itself again?"

        "After \u2018Black Warrant\u2019 & \u2018Paatal Lok\u2019, Here Are OTT Shows To Look Forward To",
        "2024 was not particularly the best year for the Indian streaming space. In fact, some fans and critics have called it the worst year for Indian OTT since Sacred Games brilliantly kicked off this trend back in 2018. However, we have witnessed two great shows in the first 3 weeks of the new year itself. Vikramaditya Motwane\u2019s Black Warrant and Sudip Sharma\u2019s Paatal Lok season 2 have already set the bar astronomically high, and it\u2019s not even the end of January.\nSo naturally, the fans are expecting more such path-breaking shows to come in the later days of the year. With the sequels to some of the most popular shows in India to some freshly brewed ideas, it looks like we won\u2019t have to settle for mediocre stuff in 2025. From thrillers to superheroes, from treasure hunts to slice-of-life, the upcoming releases are of different genres and flavors, catering to multiple taste pallets.\nHere\u2019s a list of the shows we are most excited about in 2025.\nLet me list the reasons why I will be watching The Secret Of The Shiledars \u2013 a treasure hunt, a thriller revealing secrets of some of the most prominent kings from the 17th century, and most importantly, Rajeev Khandelwal. As a character in the trailer says, \u201cThis is like an Indiana Jones movie\u201d, the show has thematic similarities to National Treasure and the Harrison Ford starring franchise. Based on the book Pratipashchandra and directed by Munjya\u2018s maker Aditya Sarpotdar, the show drops on Hotstar on the 31st of January.\nArguably the most anticipated show of 2025. It was only yesterday that the creators Raj and DK gave an update that they have wrapped up the new season. So we are assuming it\u2019s just a matter of months now before we get to see the return of Srikant Tiwari\u2019s new adventures, this time more thrilling and on a scale never seen before.\nFew shows in our country have garnered the kind of love and universal appeal that Panchayat has managed to. A massive hit in Northern India, now the show has come up with its South Indian version. Abhishek has become Shayam, Phulera in UP has been replaced by a village in Telangana, and the protagonist is taking GMAT instead of CAT. However, the fun remains the same. It started streaming on Prime Video from the 24th of January.\nThe much-awaited unnamed directorial debut of SRK\u2019s son is set to release in 2025. Produced by Gauri Khan, not much information is available about the release date right now, but that doesn\u2019t lessen our excitement even a bit.\nAfter its stellar first two seasons, the International Emmy winner is scheduled to release its next season in 2025. Created by Richie Mehta and starring Shefali Shah, Rasika Dugal, and Rajesh Tailang among others, the new season is rumored to come on Netflix somewhere in the middle of the year.\nSet in 1960s Bombay, Dabba Cartel is the story of five housewives who run a secret cartel. Their modus operandi \u2013 the famous dabbas that are one of the identities of the city itself. Starring Shabana Azmi, Jyotika, Shalini Pandey, Sai Tamhankar, Nimisha Sajayan, Anjali Anand, Gajraj Rao, and Jisshu Sengupta the series is produced by Excel Entertainment and directed by Hitesh Bhatia. It\u2019s rumored to get its release soon on Netflix.\nThe thing I miss most about the good old days of cricket is the aggression, the banters, and the fights on the pitch. We are all set to relive one of the greatest rivalries in sports with this Netflix documentary.

        "Here Are Some Reality Checks For People Who Hero-Worship Elon Musk, The Guy Who Keeps Faltering",
        "Elon Musk might have achieved several feats throughout his career, however, it is essential to step away from worshipping him like a hero and examine his actions. It is now high time to assess the man behind the massive headlines and discuss the reality.\nIn the list below, we have mentioned some compelling reasons why people should stop treating this business magnate like a hero. Read on.\n1. He\u2019s a man-child.\nFrom changing its name and charging $8 per month for blue ticks to changing the iconic blue bird to the viral doge, the man has made a joke of his micro-blogging website, Twitter. Recently, the man shared a private picture of his ex, Amber Heard, dressed as a video game character. I mean how childish and ridiculous a man can get?\n2. He has made some very insensitive statements.\nThe man, on several occasions, has said some heartless things. In 2020, he called the people \u2018dumb\u2019 to worry about the deadly coronavirus. In 2022, when Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, he came up with a bizarre list of suggestions to solve the war, through an insensitive poll on Twitter.\n3. He\u2019s sexist and homophobic.\nNeedless to mention, he also has a terrible sense of humor. In 2021, he proposed opening a school called the Texas Institute Of Technology & Science. To this, a person suggested swapping the words \u2018technology\u2019 and \u2018science\u2019. The magnate declined and said that he wanted the name to begin with the letter T \u2013 that\u2019s because the school\u2019s name makes the acronym TITS. He has also made some homophobic statements over time and made fun of people for writing pronouns in their social media bios.\n4. He has no respect for his own employees.\nIt\u2019s 2023 and the man is still promoting the toxic hustle culture. Last year, in 2022, his employees received an ultimatum from him at two in the morning which stated that their work lives would look very different now. His email said that the employees can either commit to the new \u2018hardcore culture\u2019 or leave with three months\u2019 notice. In another instance, he laid off the janitors from his office and made the employees bring their own toilet paper. He also fired an engineer over his low reach on Twitter.\nIt\u2019s high time that we stop hailing a man-child like him as a hero!"

        "HMPV Outbreak: Here\u2019s Everything You Need To Know About The Virus & Its Growth In India",
        "It has been five years since the world witnessed a global pandemic that caused seven million deaths globally. Recently, unverified videos of hospitals across China have emerged showing overcrowded emergency rooms due to the alleged spread of HMPV. The visuals, reminiscent of the early days of COVID-19 have raised global concerns, with panic among the masses.\nWhile there is no official information from the WHO regarding the cases, the internet is circulating with a lot of reports about the virus and its potential risk. Here is everything you need to know about the virus, its symptoms, transmission, treatments, prevention, and the current situation in India.\nAccording to the Cleveland Clinic, human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a virus causing symptoms similar to a cold. The cases are usually mild and children, those with weakened immune systems, and adults over the age of 65 face a higher risk of contracting such diseases. It was first identified in 2001 and generally causes both lower and upper respiratory tract infections.\nThe symptoms of HMPV are very similar to those of the common cold and include cough, fever, runny or stuffy nose, sore throat, wheezing, shortness of breath, and even rash. Severe cases can escalate to serious respiratory diseases pneumonia, asthma flare-ups, or make chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) worse, requiring medical intervention. The mild cases last for a few days or a week, whereas serious cases can last longer. People are more likely to get sick the first time, therefore children are at more risk. Later getting some immunity, they develop only mild symptoms if they the HMPV next time.\nThe spread of the virus occurs through respiratory droplets getting transferred through coughing or sneezing. It can also travel through close personal contact through handshakes or hugs or coming in direct contact with contaminated surfaces such as railings, handles, knobs, or washroom basins.\nThere aren\u2019t any antiviral medications that treat HMPV. Mild symptoms are usually manageable at home, however, serious complications require hospital admission and remain under constant care. No antibiotics have yet proven to treat HMPV, since it is a virus.\nThe transmission, however, can be prevented with care and precautions.\nAt the time of writing, India has officially reported two cases of HMPV in Bengaluru \u2013 a 3-month-old and an 8-month-old. However, the infants have no travel history. According to ICMR, \u201cIt is emphasized that HMPV is already in circulation globally, including in India, and cases of respiratory illnesses associated with HMPV have been reported in various countries.\u201d However, the top medical body also noted that India is well-equipped to handle any potential increase in illnesses. As of Friday, the Union Health Ministry also stated that it was closely monitoring the alleged outbreak of Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) in China."

        "This Travel Influencer Spent \u20b950 Lakh In A Year, And The Internet Is Struggling To Keep Up",
        "Imagine spending \u20b950 lakh in a year on traveling and calling it a lifestyle shift. That\u2019s exactly what travel influencer Sharanya Iyer did, and naturally, the internet has opinions.\nIn a now-viral Instagram reel titled \u201cHow Much I Spent in 2024\u201d, Sharanya revealed her jaw-dropping expenses, breaking down how she managed to globe-trot across six countries, buy a brand-new car, and still keep a smile on her face.\nSharanya, who boasts a following of over 503K on Instagram, shared that she visited countries like Laos, Thailand, South Africa, Greenland, Madeira, and Iceland not once but three times in 2024. Her travels alone cost her a fortune, with flights setting her back \u20b95 lakh and trips like South Africa with her parents reaching \u20b98 lakh.\nHowever, the real kicker? She also splurged \u20b922 lakh on a new Hyundai car and spent \u20b95 lakh on medical expenses her insurance didn\u2019t cover. Surprisingly, she admitted she didn\u2019t even include costs for food, shopping, or daily expenses in her calculations.\nIn the reel, Sharanya explained that this massive shift in her spending philosophy came after years of being an \u201cobsessive saver.\u201d She credited her dad and friends for pushing her to loosen her purse strings and embrace a more joyful approach to life, calling it a \u201csignificant move\u201d that helped her get through a difficult year. While her admission of spending \u20b950 lakh on travel and lifestyle changes was meant to inspire, it left the internet divided.\nA post shared by Instagram (@instagram)\nHer post quickly went viral, amassing over 1.3 million views and countless reactions. Some were curious about her finances, asking questions like, \u201cWhat\u2019s your source of income?\u201d Others couldn\u2019t wrap their heads around her budget, particularly how she managed three trips to Iceland for just \u20b92.5 lakh. Sharanya responded to one such comment, explaining that parts of her Iceland trips were sponsored, and she excluded flight costs.\nBut not all reactions were positive. Many questioned the sustainability of such extravagant spending, with one user humorously pointing out, \u201cFinance influencers are experiencing trauma after this reel.\u201d Still, some applauded her bold approach, agreeing that sometimes, it\u2019s okay to prioritize experiences over savings.\nSharanya\u2019s reel also touched on her decision to focus on cutting down material spending in 2025, a move that seems ironic considering her lavish 2024. But hey, if anyone\u2019s living the dream of turning wanderlust into a lifestyle, it\u2019s her.\nSo, would you blow \u20b950 lakh in a year to chase your adventures, or are you more team save every penny? Either way, Sharanya\u2019s reel has left us all questioning how far we\u2019d go for a year of unforgettable memories."

        "They Might Always Be On Your Screens Now, But These 9 Celebrities Have Ditched Smartphones",
        "Gone are the days when people needed their morning newspaper when the dawn broke. Nowadays, people need their morning dose of Instagram right after waking, even with squinted eyes. In this era of social media where likes and shares have become the currency of validation, you must be hardly seeing anyone around without a smartphone.\nHowever, there are some celebrities, who are not the biggest fan of smartphones. Forget smartphones, some of them are averse to using cell phones of any kind altogether. Despite being in show business, from cinema to sports, and often appearing on our phone screens, they have chosen a rather tech-free life. Professional disturbances, personal distraction \u2013 the reasons are many, but here\u2019s a list of some of them who have escaped our favourite little black mirrors.\nIn a world where an actor\u2019s stardom decides the box office of a movie, few directors pull crowds to the theaters. And Nolan\u2019s name arguably would top that list. However, I was shocked to learn that the influential director doesn\u2019t use a smartphone. Not only that, he doesn\u2019t have an email ID and refrains from using the internet. He has also banned the use of phones on his sets, for the cast and crew.\nThe Shape of You singer revealed that he decided not to keep a phone in 2015 because he was losing real-life interaction. his team gives him a phone when needed. He explained that the constant back-and-forth of messaging and the pressure of responding on time led him to adopt a phone-free lifestyle.\nThe singing sensation once revealed that he doesn\u2019t have a mobile phone, instead, he uses an\u00a0iPad\u00a0for communication. Bieber said he does this to limit the means of communication, \u201cI definitely learned how to have boundaries, and I just don\u2019t feel like I owe anybody anything,\u201d\nThe veteran actor of Dune and Pulp Fiction said that he continues to embrace a tech-free lifestyle. He doesn\u2019t use a cell phone and watches movies and shows on physical DVDs. He says he has never used emails or Twitter.\nThe Kahaani and Jagga Jasoos actor said in an interview that he once bought a smartphone and had WhatsApp and Instagram accounts made. However, he rarely used to check them because he felt they were distracting him from life and work. Now if he goes to a remote area, he carries a simple phone.\nThe CEO of Berkshire Hathaway and a minor owner of Apple shares was a long-term user of a $20 (1,438 approximately) Samsung SCH-U320 flip phone. He finally decided to ditch his old and upgraded to an iPhone 11 in 2020 at the age of 89.\nWell, we had to mention MS on this list because of all the anecdotes we hear from his team-mates. They say it\u2019s practically impossible to contact him via a phone when MS is away. The former Indian captain had said in an event in 2023, \u201cI do have a phone but I use it only to set an alarm at night. It does the job of waking me up in the morning.\u201d He was recently seen using a smartphone in a practice session, but many fans pointed out that he was just swiping notifications.\nRare video of MS Dhoni using Mobile that too in the net session \ud83d\ude01\u2764\ufe0f#MSDhoni #IPl2025 pic.twitter.com/0IgzQi2QZz\nMusic legend Sir Elton John has been vocal about his disdain for cell phones over the years. He does not even own a mobile phone and says that his husband David Furnish runs his Instagram. He credits his social media presence to his team. \u201cI don\u2019t have a phone. The office staff runs Twitter for me. I don\u2019t do it myself,\u201d Elton once said.\nThe star of Divergent and The Fault in Our Stars revealed way back that she was not a big technology fan. In fact, she revealed that she didn\u2019t even have a cellphone. Shailene said that if she were to have a phone, it would have been a flip one. According to her, there\u2019s a lack of privacy, camaraderie, and community than there\u2019s ever been, which is one of the reasons for her decision.\nWell, to most of us dropping off our smartphones sounds like a nightmare. However, if we took some time off doom-scrolling, the world may appear a little less doomed.\n"

Despite its international workforce, Maldives imposes religious laws strictly which makes it impossible to perform Hindu \"puja\" or celebrate Hindu festivals.\nThe country, located 400-500 kms away from India, is based near Kochi, Kerala. Despite its proximity to India, the religious laws pose a stark contrast when compared with religious freedom in India.\nMaldivian constitution, amended in 2008, declared the country as a 100 per cent Muslim nation. As per the article 9 of the constitution, only a Muslim can be a Maldivian citizen. Furthermore, public displays of any non-Islamic religious practices is banned.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

The two stars, who were once one of Bollywood's most loved couples, were seen hugging and chatting as paparazzi captured the rare interaction.\nWhile their unexpected interaction may have come as a happy surprise for their fans, for the Kabir Singh actor, it was a 'totally normal' moment with his ex-lover and co-star Kareena Kapoor. Speaking with media on green carpet of IIFA Digital Awards, Shahid briefly addressed his reunion with Kareena when asked. He said, \"For us, it's nothing new...aaj stage pe mile aur hum log idhar udhar milte rehte hai but it's totally normal for us...if people felt nice, it's nice.\"\nThe two stars began dating in 2004 when they were filming the romantic thriller Fida and broke up while shooting the romantic drama Jab We Met.

Two women, including an Israeli national, were allegedly raped by three men near the Hampi heritage site in Karnataka's Vijayanagara district on the night of March 6, Koppal Police said on Saturday.\n\"The horrific assault and rape of an Israeli national and a homestay owner in Sanapur, Gangavati taluk, Koppal district, is a deeply heinous crime,\" Karnataka CM posted on X.\nKarnataka CM said that the police have arrested two accused, and further investigation is underway. \"As soon as the incident was reported, I directed the concerned police officials to take immediate action, conduct a stringent investigation, and swiftly apprehend the culprits. The police have already arrested two accused and are continuing the investigation,\" he added.

We will take action as per the law,\" Shivakumar told reporters.\nSowmya Reddy, President of the Karnataka Mahila Congress, said that the Karnataka government is taking steps to ensure security and safety. \"I have not heard about this incident but I just want to say that in the last 11-12 years since the BJP government has come to power at the Centre, crimes against women have increased, women have become unsafe, so we demand equality, we demand security, we demand equal opportunity and I really want to say that the Karnataka government is taking steps to ensure security and safety,\" Reddy said.\nAccording to police, a 29-year-old homestay operator, three male tourists, and an Israeli tourist had gone to the Tungabhadra Canal near Sanapur Lake for stargazing. They were sitting near the canal, playing guitar and stargazing, when the accused approached them and asked where they could get petrol.\n\"On the night of March 6, after dinner, we decided to go and watch the stars at night. We took our scooters and rode to the bank of the Tungabhadra Canal, near Durgamma Gudi, near Sanapur Lake. While we were watching the stars and playing the guitar, around 10:30 pm, three men approached us on a motorcycle, asking for petrol in Kannada,\" the homestay operator alleged.\nShe told them that there was no petrol station nearby and that they could find petrol in Sanapur. One of the three men suddenly demanded 100 rupees. \"Since they did not know us, I told them that I did not have any money with me. However, as they repeatedly insisted, one of the male tourists gave them 20 rupees,\" the complainant said.\nWhen they refused to give them more money, the accused started arguing and threatening them with stones. Two of the accused allegedly assaulted and raped the homestay operator and Israeli tourist, while the third pushed the male tourists into the water canal, she said.\nAccording to the FIR, two of the accused assaulted the homestay operator, and the third man aggressively pushed the three male tourists into the canal. The accused also hit her with stones.\n\"I was seriously bleeding...Two of the accused joined forces and dragged me to the side of the canal. One of them strangled me and took off my clothes. One by one they forcibly beat me and raped me,\" the homestay operator alleged in her complaint.\nShe further said that the accused also snatched her bag and took away her two mobile phones and Rs 9500 in cash. Similarly, one of the accused dragged the Israeli tourist away and raped her.\n\"While we were screaming and crying, the three men left with their motorcycle,\" she alleged.She also mentioned that the accused spoke Kannada and Telugu and that she might be able to recognize them.\nBased on their complaint, a case has been registered at Gangavathi Rural Police Station under relevant sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) 2023, including charges of attempt to murder, robbery, and rape. Koppal Superintendent of Police Ram Arasiddi said that two suspects have been arrested in Gangavathi in connection with the case.\n\"On March 6, five people - two women and three men - were attacked by three miscreants. The attackers assaulted the three men and sexually abused the two women. Based on the victims' complaint, we have registered a case of attempted murder, robbery, and rape,\" SP Arasiddi said.\n\"Based on the information provided, we have arrested two suspects, Sai Mallu and Chethan Sai, both from Gangavathi. A third accused is still at large, but we have identified him and will catch him soon,\" he added.

'Uleri', which was released last year, is such a bold story idea. Even their horror films, like I saw a film called 'Bramayugam,' which is a Mammootty film, incredibly artistically made using folk tales and the folklore of Kerala, and it's a very different idea. There is a sort of a sense of conviction about telling stories that are different. And I think that's what stands them in great stead.\"\nKiran, however, shared that the makers in South cinema are ready to take chances as it's a small industry, and they know their audience very well. \"It's the chances that they are taking with the stories they are telling, and perhaps that also comes from the fact that they are usually smaller industries that are technically only catering to their own, culturally, their language and their community. And so they are quite unafraid to try different things. They know their audience, and their producers are willing to take chances on new storytelling,\" she added.\nShe said what is incredible is that \"the audience is going to watch films,\" and the makers are \"very much in touch with their audience. They understand their audience very well.\" However, she shared that Bollywood is big, and while making the movie, filmmakers keep in mind that they have to cater for a \"wider audience\". \"You are making films for a diaspora, you are making films for all the states of the country. And I think maybe that is why people want to make something that they are very sure will succeed, and maybe that's why there's a tendency to go to a film that's already successful, like a remake,\" she said. She insisted that it is important to have \"producers who are willing to take a chance\" if you are willing to have a different cinema.\nRao started her career as the assistant director in the epic film 'Lagaan', directed by Ashutosh Gowariker, whom she also assisted later on 'Swades: We, the People'. Lagaan was nominated for the 74th Academy Award in the foreign language film category. Aamir Khan produced and starred in the same film. Before 'Lagaan', she also played a minute role as a supporting actress in 'Dil Chahta Hai'. She has directed the films 'Dhobi Ghat' (2011) and 'Laapataa Ladies' (2024).\n\r\n\t(This story has not been edited by DNA staff and is published from ANI)\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "EXPLAINER\nThe earthquake that hit Delhi on Monday had a depth of about 5 kilometers, according to the National Centre of Seismology, making it a shallow-focus earthquake. During such quakes, loud rumbling or boom sounds are often heard.\nSagar Malik\nUpdated : Feb 17, 2025, 05:44 PM IST\nMany residents in national capital Delhi woke up in panic early on Monday morning as a strong earthquake hit the city and adjoining regions. A loud boom sound was also heard by people when the quake struck. Here\u2019s what caused the mysterious sound.\nWhat was the boom sound?\r\n\tThe earthquake that hit Delhi on Monday had a depth of about 5 kilometers, according to the National Centre of Seismology, making it a shallow-focus earthquake. During such quakes, loud rumbling or boom sounds are often heard.\nThis is because high-frequency ground vibrations from shallow earthquakes reach the atmosphere and become sound waves.\nThe shallower the earthquake\u2019s epicentre, the greater its potential to generate loud sounds.\n\u201cWhen earthquakes are deeper, those vibrations never reach the surface. Sometimes, earthquakes create booming sounds even when no vibrations are felt,\u201d according to the US Geological Survey (USGS).\nEarthquake in Delhi\r\n\tAn earthquake with a magnitude of 4 on the Richter Scale struck Delhi around 5:30 am on Monday. The epicentre of the quake was Jheel Park in Dhaula Kuan area, according to the National Center for Seismology.\nAn earthquake below 2.5 magnitude is considered \u201cmild\u201d and does not cause tremors. A quake with magnitude between 2.5 and 5.4 is labeled \u201cmoderate,\u201d causing minor tremors. Those above 5.4 magnitude are considered \u201csevere\u201d earthquakes and have the potential to cause strong tremors and damage.\nDelhi is described by experts as being at moderate to high risk of experiencing earthquakes.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "INDIA\nOn the occasion of International Women's Day, Adani Group, Chairman, Gautam Adani reaffirmed his commitment to gender equality and empowering women in all walks of life.\nMeemansa Shekhawat\nUpdated : Mar 08, 2025, 01:44 PM IST\nOn the occasion of International Women's Day, Adani Group, Chairman, Gautam Adani reaffirmed his commitment to gender equality and empowering women in all walks of life. In a heartfelt message, he shared how his granddaughters have strengthened his resolve to build a world where women face no barriers in achieving their dreams. Gautam Adani spoke about the strong women who shaped his journey, including his mother, wife Priti Adani, and others that he met through his work.\nHe recalled how his mother managed their large family with resilience and how his wife's dedication to the Adani Foundation has transformed lives across rural India.\nIn a social media post he said, \"A decade ago, as I cradled my first granddaughter's delicate fingers, I made a silent vow: to help build a world where her aspirations would know no bounds, where her voice would resonate with the same respect as any man's, and where her worth would be measured solely by her character and contributions\".\nHe further added, \"Now, blessed with three beautiful granddaughters, this promise burns brighter and more urgent than ever. International Women's Day is not merely a date on the calendar; it's a poignant reminder of the strides we've made and the journey that still lies ahead. For me, this mission is deeply personal across many dimensions - as a young boy being inspired by his mother, as a business leader witnessing the challenges faced by women in leadership, as a husband inspired by my wife Priti's unwavering dedication to the Adani Foundation, and as a grandfather dreaming of a world without limits for the girls who affectionately call me \"Dadu.\"\nHe also highlighted key initiatives by the Adani Foundation, such as the Butterfly Effect framework, which supports women throughout different stages of life, and the Lakhpati Didis program, which has helped over 1,000 women achieve financial independence.\nHe said \"Moreover, our 'Lakhpati Didis' initiative celebrates over 1,000 women who have achieved financial independence through enhanced entrepreneurial skills\". Gautam Adani shared a personal experience of visiting one of his company's ports, where he noticed the lack of women in leadership roles. This led him to push for change, ensuring policies were more inclusive and providing mentorship opportunities for women.\nHe added, \"Several years ago, during a visit to one of our port projects, I noticed the absence of women in operational and leadership roles. It was not due to a lack of capability but rather the absence of pathways for them into these traditionally male-dominated fields. This realization sparked a personal commitment to change\".\nDespite progress, he acknowledged that many women still face challenges in leadership roles. He expressed hope that his granddaughters would one day enter boardrooms where they are valued as equals.\nGautam Adani said, \"Yet, beneath that pride is a quiet impatience. Because despite how far we have come, my granddaughters may still enter boardrooms where they are the only women at the table. They may still have to fight harder, speak louder, and prove themselves twice over to receive the recognition they deserve. They may still face doors that open too slowly, or not at all\".\nFor his granddaughters he added \"And to my granddaughters, who may one day read this: My dearest girls, The world you inherit should be one where your brilliance is met with open doors, not glass ceilings. Where your ambitions are never questioned, only encouraged. Where your voice is not just heard, but sought after. I vow to keep pushing, to keep breaking barriers, until that world is not just a vision but a reality. Because you, and every girl like you, deserve to walk into every room knowing you belong. Your Dadu.\"\nConcluding his message, he urged men in leadership positions to see gender equality as a shared responsibility, stating, \"The talents, insights, and leadership of women are invaluable resources we cannot afford to squander.\n\"This year's International Women's Day theme, Accelerate Action, resonates deeply with vision of creating an inclusive future where every woman can thrive\".\nExcept for the headline, the story has not been edited by DNA staff and is published from ANI.\n\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "Amid tariff war, Donald Trump hints at revisiting US-Canada border demarcation treaty",
        "WORLD\nThe report, which cited four people with firsthand knowledge of their content, on the condition of anonymity, also noted that Trump, in an early February call, challenged the border treaty between the two countries and told Trudeau he didn't like their shared water agreements.\nSagar Malik\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 08:58 AM IST\nAmid the ongoing tariff war between the two countries, US President Donald Trump, during his conversation with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, raised the point that he did not believe in the border demarcation treaty between them and wants to revise the boundary, the New York Times reported.\nThe report, which cited four people with firsthand knowledge of their content, on the condition of anonymity, also noted that Trump, in an early February call, challenged the border treaty between the two countries and told Trudeau he didn't like their shared water agreements.\nRecently, Justin Trudeau made an extraordinary statement that was largely lost in the fray of the moment, as per NYT.\r\n\t\"The excuse that he's giving for these tariffs today of fentanyl is completely bogus, completely unjustified, completely false,\" Trudeau told the news media in Ottawa.\n\"What he wants is to see a total collapse of the Canadian economy, because that'll make it easier to annex us,\" he added.\r\n\tThe conversation between Washington and Ottawa on February 3 not only included discussions on staving off tariffs on Canadian exports but Trump also laid out a long list of grievances he had with the trade relationship between the two countries, including Canada's protected dairy sector, the difficulty American banks face in doing business in Canada and Canadian consumption taxes that Trump deems unfair because they make American goods more expensive.\nNotably, the border treaty that Trump referred to was established in 1908 and finalized the international boundary between Canada, then a British dominion, and the United States, as reported by NYT.\nTrump also mentioned revisiting the sharing of lakes and rivers between the two nations, which is regulated by a number of treaties, a topic he's expressed interest in in the past.\nThe report further cited Trump's response to the media on January 7, wherein, he had said that he is planning to use \"economic force\" against Canada.\nThe persistent social media references to Canada as the \"51st state\" and Trudeau as its \"Governor\" had begun to grate both inside the Canadian government and more broadly, as reported by NYT.\nFollowing the talks between the two leaders, Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick in a conversation with Canada's finance minister, Dominic LeBlanc, issued a devastating message, according to several people familiar with the call that Trump, he said, had come to realize that the relationship between the United States and Canada was governed by a slew of agreements and treaties that were 'easy to abandon.'\nHe also wanted to eject Canada out of an intelligence-sharing group known as the 'Five Eyes' that also includes Britain, Australia and New Zealand, according to NYT.\nHe wanted to tear up the Great Lakes agreements and conventions between the two nations that lay out how they share and manage Lakes Superior, Huron, Erie and Ontario, the report further added.\nIt also noted that he is also reviewing military cooperation between the two countries, particularly the North American Aerospace Defence Command.\nA sigh of relief, however, has been that the Secretary of State Marco Rubio, has refrained from delivering threats, and recently dismissed the idea that the United States was looking at scrapping military cooperation.\nHowever, Canada's politicians across the spectrum, and Canadian society at large, are frayed and deeply concerned. Officials do not see the Trump administration's threats as empty; they see a new normal when it comes to the United States, the report added.\n\r\n\t(This story has not been edited by DNA staff and is published from ANI).\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "Trump, Musk, NASA, and SpaceX: The fight over Sunita Williams\u2019 return",
        "WORLD\nPresident Donald Trump said he had personally asked Elon Musk for help in bringing astronauts back from the International Space Station. He also used the moment to criticize President Biden and his administration.\nGirish Linganna\nUpdated : Mar 08, 2025, 06:29 PM IST\nPresident Donald Trump said he had personally asked Elon Musk for help in bringing astronauts back from the International Space Station. He also used the moment to criticize President Biden and his administration.\nThe SpaceX Dragon spacecraft, which will bring astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore back to Earth, has been at the space station since September and was always supposed to bring them back home. Even so, Trump mentioned in the Oval Office on Thursday, March 6, that he had given Elon permission a week earlier to bring them back.\nTrump also said that former President Joe Biden felt embarrassed about the situation and decided to leave them there.\nThe astronauts earlier told CNN's Anderson Cooper that they don\u2019t feel \"stuck\" at the space station. However, NASA and the astronauts have struggled to completely dismiss this idea, partly because of the political back-and-forth involving Trump and Musk.\nWilmore reassured Cooper on February 13 that they don\u2019t feel abandoned, stuck, or stranded. He was responding to a question about Trump\u2019s remarks, as reported by USA Today.\nWhat\u2019s the latest with the Starliner?\nAstronauts Wilmore and Williams were chosen for the first crewed flight of the Starliner. In June 2024, they launched on a mission to test the Boeing Starliner, which is designed to eventually carry NASA astronauts to space alongside SpaceX\u2019s Dragon.\nBoth astronauts are highly experienced and are making their third trip to the space station.\nNASA found technical problems with the spacecraft, which delayed the astronauts' return home. In the end, the space agency had to bring the Starliner back to Earth in early September without its crew.\nThe SpaceX Dragon spacecraft, which will now bring astronauts Williams and Wilmore back to Earth, has been at the space station since late September. It originally arrived with the Crew-9 mission.\nAs part of NASA's plan, the spacecraft carried only two astronauts instead of the usual four. This left extra seats available for Williams and Wilmore on the trip back to Earth.\nThe Boeing\u00a0 Starliner crew members, Sunita Williams and Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore, joined the Crew-9 mission, whose astronauts are still completing their full stay in space.\nNASA announced in a mission update that the Dragon capsule, carrying the four astronauts of Crew-10, is set to launch as early as March 12. It will travel on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Kennedy Space Center in Florida, replacing the Crew-9 team.\nAs the name implies, this is the 10th crew rotation mission to the space station under NASA's commercial crew program.\nAstronaut Hague said in a news conference from space on Tuesday, March 4, that Crew-9 will pass the mission to Crew-10 before returning to Earth after a successful long stay.\nWhen the new astronauts reach the space station, there will be a few days of handover activities. After that, Williams and Wilmore will join Crew-9 in the SpaceX Dragon to leave the station, possibly around March 25.\nNASA astronaut Nick Hague will lead the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft as it returns to Earth, along with Mission Specialists Suni Williams, Butch Wilmore, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov. The crew practiced on Tuesday, 4th March using Dragon's computer tablets and reviewed the steps needed for the spacecraft to move away from the space station and reenter Earth's atmosphere before landing in the ocean near Florida. Hague and Gorbunov have been on the station since September 29, 2024, while Williams and Wilmore arrived on June 6.\n\n(The author Girish Linganna of this article is an award-winning Science Writer and a Defence, Aerospace & Political Analyst based in Bengaluru.

The officer had said that while Holi is celebrated once a year, Friday prayers happen every week. He suggested that those uncomfortable with Holi colours should stay indoors.\nSpeaking at the India Today Conclave, Adityanath said the officer, though speaking in a straightforward manner, was correct. He thanked religious leaders for deciding to hold Friday prayers after 2 PM this year, as Holi falls on the same day. He also said that those who wish to pray earlier can do so at home.\nSambhal, which saw communal violence last year, has been in focus after the police officer\u2019s remark. The opposition Samajwadi Party has criticised the officer, calling him biased toward the ruling BJP.\nAt the event, Adityanath also addressed the recent Maha Kumbh stampede, where 30 pilgrims died on January 29. He denied claims that the government tried to hide the number of deaths. He said the administration\u2019s first priority was helping the injured and managing the large crowd. Once the situation was under control, the media was informed.\nThe Chief Minister also called the Maha Kumbh a symbol of unity and a lesson for those who questioned its significance.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

This match also marks the conclusion of their home leg in Lucknow, and they are eager to end their disappointing campaign on a positive note. Unfortunately, the Warriorz were knocked out of the playoffs race after the results from Friday night, with the Gujarat Giants securing eight points. This situation has also placed the Royal Challengers Bengaluru in a must-win scenario following a string of losses during their home leg.\nThe Indian players, especially in batting, have faced challenges for the Warriorz, with Grace Harris, Georgia Voll, Chinelle Henry, and Sophie Ecclestone all needing to elevate their game. While Uma Chetry, Vrinda Dinesh, and Kiran Navgire have shown potential, their performances haven't been sufficient to back up the overseas stars. Even captain Deepti Sharma has struggled to make a significant impact.\nOn the flip side, RCB is counting on captain Smriti Mandhana to guide the team to victory. The team's reliance on Ellyse Perry has revealed vulnerabilities in the lineup, particularly with some key players absent. Sneh Rana and Kim Garth, stepping in as replacements, have done well, but RCB needs their top players to rise to the occasion. RCB must secure wins in two consecutive matches to compete with the Giants and the Mumbai Indians for a playoff spot. Thus, the upcoming match against the UP Warriorz is vital for the defending champions as they wrap up their league stage at the CCI against Mumbai.\nLive Streaming Details\nThe Women's Premier League (WPL) 2025 match between UP Warriorz and Royal Challengers Bengaluru is scheduled to take place on Saturday, March 8. The match will be held at the Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow , with kick-off set for 7:30 PM IST. Fans can catch all the action live on the Sports18 Network, for those unable to watch on TV, the match will also be available for live streaming on the JioCinema app and website.\nPitch report\nIn the matches played at the venue, Gujarat scored the highest score of 186 in the first game. The subsequent games saw a decrease in total scores, with UP scoring 150 and Gujarat chasing a total of 177 in the following match. Lucknow has hosted three games, with the 150-run mark being surpassed in five out of six innings. Spinners have been more successful than fast bowlers, with a better average and economy rate compared to seamers.\nWeather report\nThe weather at Ekana Stadium will be warm with hazy sunshine, temperatures around 32 degrees, and a RealFeel of 33 degrees. However, the air quality will be very unhealthy. There will be a gentle breeze from the west-northwest at 11 km/h, occasionally shifting the stagnant air with gusts up to 28 km/h, creating a mix of warmth and discomfort.\nPredicted playing XIs\nUP Warriorz: Kiran Navgire, Grace Harris, Georgia Voll, Vrinda Dinesh, Deepti Sharma (c), Shweta Sehrawat, Chinelle Henry, Uma Chetry (wk), Sophie Ecclestone, Kranti Goud, Gouher Sultana/Saima Thakor\nRoyal Challengers Bengaluru: Smriti Mandhana (c), Danielle Wyatt-Hodge, Ellyse Perry, Raghvi Bist/S Meghana, Kanika Ahuja, Richa Ghosh (wk), Georgia Wareham, Kim Garth, Sneh Rana, Renuka Singh Thakur, Ekta Bisht/Prema Rawat\nAlso read| UPW-W vs RCB-W WPL 2025 Dream11 prediction: Fantasy cricket tips for UP Warriorz Women vs Royal Challengers Bengaluru Women\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "VIRAL\nAmong her many prized jewels, one gemstone holds a special place in Nita Ambani's heart\nShivam Verma\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 08:32 AM IST\nNita Ambani, a successful entrepreneur and wife of business tycoon Mukesh Ambani, is known for her impeccable fashion sense and stunning jewelry collection. Among her many prized jewels, one gemstone holds a special place in her heart \u2014 the emerald. But for Nita Ambani, this dazzling green gem is more than just an accessory; it is believed to bring good luck, prosperity, and positivity.\nIn astrology, emerald, known as \u2018panna\u2019 in Hindi, is associated with financial stability, health benefits, and good fortune. Many believe that wearing an emerald can attract wealth and success, making it a powerful symbol of abundance. It is also linked to Goddess Lakshmi, the deity of prosperity, further enhancing its spiritual significance.\nEmeralds have been valued throughout history, particularly in Indian culture. Ancient rulers and Mughal emperors admired their rich green color and mystical properties. In Western traditions, emeralds are connected to Venus, the Roman goddess of love and beauty, symbolizing nature, fertility, and eternal youth.\nBeyond its cultural and spiritual significance, emeralds are also believed to have health benefits. Some say the gemstone can help reduce eye problems and bring emotional balance. It is also thought to drive away negativity, replacing it with peace and positivity.\nMany people admire Nita Ambani\u2019s success and see her love for emeralds as a reflection of her belief in their positive energy. For her, the emerald is not just a beautiful gemstone but a symbol of faith, prosperity, and well-being.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "CRICKET\nIndia vs New Zealand Live Cricket Score: The Men in Blue and the Blackcaps are all set to clash at the Dubai International Stadium for the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 title. This is the third consecutive time the Indian side has reached to the finals of the Champions Trophy.\nAseem Sharma\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 02:55 PM IST\nIndia vs New Zealand Live Cricket Score: Rohit Sharma-led Men in Blue are set to lock horns against Mitchell Santner's Blackcaps in the Final match of the ICC Champions Trophy 2025. After clinching a semi-final game against the World Champions Australia, Team India became the first team to reach the finals. On the other hand, the Kiwis defeated the South African side to make it to the finals. Both the teams faced each other in the tournament in the league stage and the game was won by Team India convincingly. Interestingly, India has reached the finals of the Champions Trophy for the third consecutive time, lifting the trophy in 2013 and losing the final match against Pakistan in 2017. So, stay tuned to this space for all the latest and live updates about the IND vs NZ game.\nAfter winning the crucial toss, New Zealand openers Will Young and Rachin Ravindra have provided a good start to their team. After 5 overs, NZ 37/0.\nWill Young hits the first boundary of the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 Final. After 1 over, NZ 4/0 with Young and Rachin out in the middle.\n\n\nNew Zealand (Playing XI) - Will Young, Rachin Ravindra, Kane Williamson, Daryl Mitchell, Tom Latham (WK), Glenn Phillips, Michael Bracewell, Mitchell Santner (C), Nathan Smith (In for Matt Henry), Kyle Jamieson, Will O Rourke.\nIndia (Unchanged Playing XI) - Rohit Sharma (C), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, Axar Patel, KL Rahul (WK), Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, Mohammad Shami, Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakaravarthy.\n\nBad luck for the Indian skipper in the toss continues as he lost his 12th straight one today. New Zealand skipper Mitchell Santner elected to bat first against the Men in Blue in the Final of ICC Champions Trophy 2025.\n\n\nIndia's star player Virat Kohli suffered a minor knee injury one day ahead of the Champions Trophy 2025 Final match. Fans are worried about Kohli's fitness for an important game like today's and this question will be answered when skipper Rohit Sharma arrives for the toss.\nOn the other hand, New Zealand's star pacer Matt Henry, who has taken important wickets in the tournament so far, suffered a shoulder injury while fielding in the semi-final match against South Africa.\n\nThe Indian skipper, who might be leading the team in winning matches in ICC events, has been facing tough luck in the toss. He has lost 11 consecutive toss in a row. So, will Rohit be able to put an end to this unique streak in today's game?\n\nA post shared by ICC (@icc)\nSeveral reports recently claimed that skipper Rohit Sharma might take retirement from the 50-over format just like he did after clinching the T20 World Cup. Speaking on the ongoing rumours, former skipper Sourav Ganguly said, ''Why is there talk of Rohit Sharma's retirement? Why is this even a question? He won the World Cup just a few months ago. I don't know what the selectors are thinking, Rohit is playing very well.''\n''India is far better than New Zealand. India played in the 2023 World Cup finals, won the 2024 T20 World Cup, and they are still unbeaten in this Champions Trophy. The same team will play,'' India Today reported quoting Sourav.\n\nTotal Matches Played - 119\nIndia - 61\nNew Zealand - 50\nTied - 1\nNo Result - 7\n\nThe Final of the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 between India and New Zealand can be viewed on Star Sports network and Jio Hotstar for live streaming on OTT.\nIndia and New Zealand have faced each other five times in the knockout stages of ICC tournaments wherein the Blackcaps have come out on top three times while the Men in Blue tasted success twice. Interestingly, India beat New Zealand in the 2000 edition of the Champions Trophy (then ICC KnockOut Trophy) in the quarterfinals but lost the game in the Final match by 4 wickets.\nBoth India and New Zealand have lifted the Champions Trophy in the past. While the Blackcaps clinched the inaugural tournament (then ICC KnockOut Trophy), Team India won the Champions Trophy in 2013 and shared the title with Sri Lanka in 2002.\nA post shared by ICC (@icc)\nTeam India's vice-captain Shubman Gill has given an update on whether skipper Rohit Sharma is retiring or not from the 50-over format after the completion of the ongoing ICC event. Speaking at the pre-match conference, Gill said, ''No discussion in the dressing room or with me, even Rohit bhai would be thinking about the Champions Trophy final lime all of us. So, nothing like that now.''\n''I think once the match ends tomorrow, he will make a decision. There is no talk about it within the setup,'' he added.\n\nThe New Zealand captain is confident of his team's ability ahead of the Champions Trophy Final. ''It's easy to say it's just another game, it's obviously not, but I think the way you approach it has to be the same. We've done a lot of good stuff this tournament, we're just trying to progress and build on the things we've been doing as a team.''\nThe New Zealand captain is confident of his team's ability ahead of the #ChampionsTrophy Final\n\r\n\t\tMore from Mitchell Santner https://t.co/1nUEF7mnrc pic.twitter.com/vgoTyITBFz\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

Be it career or marriage, ego amplifies pains and erases pleasures. Stronger the ego, weaker are relationships.\u201d\nHis post sparked discussions among netizens.

        "Emmanuel Macron's France hits big JACKPOT, discovers world\u2019s largest deposit of..., it is worth...",
        "WORLD\nThe massive deposit, located beneath the soil of Folswiller in the Moselle region, is estimated to hold 46 million tonnes of hydrogen\nShivam Verma\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 09:01 AM IST\nFrance has made a big discovery in green energy with the largest known natural hydrogen reserve on the planet. The massive deposit, located beneath the soil of Folswiller in the Moselle region, is estimated to hold 46 million tonnes of hydrogen. According to reports, the value of this reserve is around $92 trillion, with expectations that its worth will rise in the future.\nThis discovery, made by researchers from the Georesources Laboratory and CNRS, was unexpected.\nScientists were originally searching for methane but instead found an enormous supply of white hydrogen buried 1,250 meters underground. This form of hydrogen is a potential game-changer as it provides a clean energy source without carbon emissions.\nUnlike green hydrogen, which requires electricity from renewable sources for production, or grey hydrogen, which is derived from fossil fuels and contributes to pollution, white hydrogen is naturally occurring. It is found deep underground and does not require complex industrial processes or generate harmful emissions.\nCurrently, the world\u2019s hydrogen economy faces challenges due to high production costs and dependency on fossil fuels. White hydrogen presents a cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative. If similar reserves are found elsewhere, it could spark a global shift toward sustainable energy.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "HEALTH\nEven in your wildest dreams, have you ever thought that wearing a Saree and Petticoat may lead to skin cancer? Let's get to discover it further.\nMeemansa Shekhawat\nUpdated : Jan 31, 2025, 04:04 PM IST\nIn India, wearing Saree and Petticoat is deeply ingrained in our culture and fashion. While the origin of the trend dates back to ancient times, it is still a part of every Indian woman's wardrobe.\nBut, even in your wildest dreams, have you ever thought that wearing a Saree and Petticoat may lead to skin cancer? Yes, you heard that right. A research has shown that wearing tight petticoats teamed with sarees draped around the waist can put a lot of pressure on the abdomen, causing skin cancer.\nWhile wearing a Saree, many women tighten their petticoats (or underskirts), which can cause rashes, itching or other skin issues, ultimately generating the risk of cancer, doctors have observed.\nOver time, skin cancer may result from the tight petticoats increasing pressure on the waist and consistent rubbing on the skin.\nCauses of Saree and Petticoat cancer\nSome of the prominent causes of Saree and Petticoat cancer include continuous friction from the tight waist string, daily pressure on the abdomen from the pleats of Saree, sweat or moisture, absence of sunlight in such parts of the body.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of Saree and Petticoat cancer include - Darkening of the skin around the waist, red, itchy patches, formation of ulcers, and raised lumps around the waist.\nPreventive measures\nAs per a report by India Today, Dr Nataraj Naidu, Consultant Surgical Oncologist, SPARSH Hospital, Bangalore, suggest that women opt for looser, breathable fabric. They should ensure proper hygeine and follow regular skincare routines.\nMoreover, they should avoid wearing a saree on a regular basis and go for skin examination, in case, they develop unusual signs.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "HEALTH\nHere are five steps to improve overall health and lower the likelihood of cancer.\nShweta Singh\nUpdated : Feb 03, 2025, 06:32 AM IST\nCancer remains one of the most life-threatening diseases globally, affecting millions of people each year. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), cancer was responsible for nearly 10 million deaths in 2020, making it one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. The disease can affect any part of the body and often progresses silently, making early detection and prevention crucial. While genetic factors play a role, lifestyle choices significantly impact cancer risk. As we observe World Cancer Day 2025, it is essential to raise awareness about the steps individuals can take to reduce their risk and lead healthier lives. Here are five steps to improve overall health and lower the likelihood of cancer.\n1. Maintain a Healthy Diet\nEating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can strengthen the immune system and reduce inflammation. Avoiding processed foods, excessive sugar, and red meat can also lower cancer risk.\n2. Stay Physically Active\nRegular exercise helps maintain a healthy weight, regulate hormones, and boost immunity. Engaging in at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity, such as walking, cycling, or yoga, can significantly reduce the risk of various cancers.\n3. Avoid Tobacco and Limit Alcohol\nSmoking is one of the leading causes of cancer, particularly lung, throat, and mouth cancers. Quitting tobacco and reducing alcohol consumption can drastically lower the chances of developing several types of cancer.\n4. Protect Yourself from the Sun\nSkin cancer is one of the most common types, but it is highly preventable. Using sunscreen, wearing protective clothing, and avoiding excessive sun exposure, especially during peak hours, can help reduce the risk of skin cancer.\n5. Schedule Regular Screenings and Check-ups\nEarly detection can make a significant difference in cancer treatment. Regular health check-ups and screenings, such as mammograms, pap smears, and colonoscopies, can help identify potential risks and ensure timely medical intervention.\nAlso read:\u00a0World Cancer Day 2025: Signs and symptoms of early-stage cervical cancer\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this article is for general informational purposes only.

It is up to us to ensure that our children reap the dividends of our commitments tomorrow. So we will face it, together.\"\n\r\n\tMacron warned that Europe must be prepared to stand alone in the face of Russian aggression. \"I want to believe the US will stay by our side,\" said Macron. \"But we have to be ready if that isn't the case.\"\n\r\n\t\"The future of Europe does not have to be decided in Washington or Moscow,\" he added.\nMacron added that he plans next week to hold a meeting of army chiefs from European countries willing to send troops to Ukraine after any eventual peace deal with Russia, as per Al Jazeera.\nMacron also said he would discuss with his European partners extending French nuclear deterrence to other countries on the continent, but that the decision and control would continue to remain in the French president's hands.\n\"France will follow only one course: that of the will for peace and freedom, faithful to its history and its principles. The homeland needs you and your commitment,\" Macron said in a post on X.\nAs per Al Jazeera, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Macron's speech in which he called Russia a threat to France and Europe was \"extremely confrontational\".\nThe speech indicates that France is thinking about \"continuing the war\".

        "BOLLYWOOD\nAfter Urvashi Rautela, Yami Gautam, and Pulkit Samrat-starrer Sanam Re was panned by critics and audiences in 2016, Divya Khosla Kumar has never directed a film in the last nine years.\nAman Wadhwa\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 02:20 PM IST | Edited by : Aman Wadhwa\nThe 2016 romantic drama Sanam Re, directed by Divya Khosla Kumar, was led by Pulkit Samrat, Yami Gautam, and Urvashi Rautela. One of the videos from the promotional interviews of the film has now resurfaced on social media, in which Urvashi is saying that she was the \"first\" to join the film, similar to her other \"first\" claims, and she is hilariously interrupted by Yami and Pulkit.\nTalking to Box Office India, Urvashi said, \"I was the first one to join the cast. That time the cast wasn\u2019t decided, who is going to play what.\" Yami interrupted and stated, \"That\u2019s what was told to everybody. We all were on board.\" Pulkit further jokingly added, \"Mujhse wo puch rahe the, Ye kaisi hai, ye kaisi hai (They were asking me. How is she? How is her as the heroine?).\nReacting to them, Urvashi added, \"So maybe she (Divya Khosla Kumar) kept it under wraps or whatever. So yeah, I signed that time. That\u2019s how it all started. A lot of people believe that I got it because of Love Dose, the song with Yo Yo Honey Singh, the international music video.\" Pulkit again interrupted and stated, \"You were so bad in that, Urvashi. How can you get it because of that?\". Urvashi stated, \"People do tell me that. I mean I signed this movie first. It somehow came later. That\u2019s how it happened. I have a very wonderful association with them. I did a song \u2018Daddy Mummy\u2019. I have 3 movie deal with them. This is the first film, and I am really excited about it. And Im also happy with the character which I am playing. It\u2019s a treat to work with her. She is an amazing director.\"\nA post shared by Bollywood ORRYginals (@thebollywoodorryginals)\nApart from Urvashi, Yami, and Pulkit, Sanam Re also featured Rishi Kapoor, Prachi Shah, Bharti Singh, and Manoj Joshi in key roles. Made in Rs 25 crore, Sanam Re earned Rs 27 crore net in India and grossed Rs 38 crore worldwide. The film was panned by the critics and audiences.

        "Bigg Boss 18 winner Karan Veer Mehra opens up on marriage plans with Chum Darang: 'She has a past, I have a past'",
        "TELEVISION\nKaran Veer Mehra and Chum Darang's relationship was one of the most discussed topics in the Salman Khan-hosted Bigg Boss 18.\nAman Wadhwa\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 03:20 PM IST | Edited by : Aman Wadhwa\nHosted by Salman Khan, the controversial reality show saw the two lovebirds Karan Veer Mehra and Chum Darang in the Grand Finale. While Chum ended as the fourth runner up, Karan went on to win the show. Even after Bigg Boss 18 ended in January, the two have taken forward their relationship forward and have been sharing their romantic photos on social media.\nThough Karan and Chum haven't officially confirmed their relationship status, they celebrated the Valentine's Day together in February. In a video shared by Chum from their dinner date, Karan even professed her love for her saying, \"Roses are red, Violets are blue, I don\u2019t care about anybody but I love you\", but they both laughed it off.\nNow, in his recent interview with Brut India, Karan was asked about his marriage plans with Chum and he replied, \"Now, I don't look nice while talking about marriage because people will get confused that I am getting married or cutting birthday cake every year. So, as Salman sir said the choice always lies with the girl.\"\nTalking about his relationship with Chum, he further added, \"With Chum and me right now, we are starting afresh. We are starting how we started in Bigg Boss, we are meeting, 'Hello, hi kaise ho?' because there are different tasks and different obstacles that we will go through in this Bigg Boss house (outside) which is abnormal. I call it abnormal, that (Bigg Boss) was normal. So, we are taking slow because she also has a past, I have a past. There are opinions here and there. There will be 100 messages and people saying something, so how do we cope with this is going to be our challenge right now.\"\nMeanwhile, Karan Veer Mehra has had two failed marriages. He was married to his childhood sweetheart Devika Mehra for nine years from 2009 to 2018. In 2021, he tied the knot again with actress Nidhi Seth and divorced her in 2023. In Bigg Boss 18, Chum Darang had stated that she was involved in a decade-long relationship with her ex boyfriend.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

In the post that has gone viral, the user said his father was an \"extremely qualified\" Physics educator.\n\"His only wish is to be respected which apparently is too much to ask for in private schools,\" the Redditor said.\nThe father holds an MSc degree from the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur and has over 30 years of teaching experience, according to the post.\n\"He married late and I'm young - still studying. I do work and do some freelance writing but it's not enough to support our family. Today, on a call with me, he broke down and told me how he's constantly berated and insulted at his workplace. He said he cannot take it anymore. I lost my mom a little over a year ago and I don't want to lose him too,\" the user shared.\n\"He's very knowledgeable and passionate about education and he does not deserve this.

India remains unbeaten in the tournament, while the Kiwis have been strong under Mitchell Santner's leadership. The clash promises to be an epic sequel to the 2000 ICC Champions Trophy final, which New Zealand won. The Men in Blue would like to avenge losses to the Blackcaps in the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup semifinal and the 2021 ICC World Test Championship final.\nIndia claimed last week's contest against the Kiwis by 44 runs, after posting 249 runs from their 50 overs and restricting New Zealand to 205 all out in the 46th over. While there's been a lot of focus on spin bowlers stepping up in the UAE, it was Matt Henry who starred with the ball for the Black Caps, claiming 5/42 off eight overs, in an innings where Shreyas Iyer top-scored for India with 79 off 98 balls.\nKane Williamson fought valiantly for the Kiwis with 81 (120 balls), but couldn't find support in the middle order. India's spinners combined for nine wickets, led by 'secret weapon' Varun Chakravarthy, who took 5/42 -- coincidentally the exact figures as Henry for the Kiwis -- in what was just the 33-year-old leg-spinner's second One Day International.\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by DNA staff and is published from ANI)\n\n\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "Key changes and deadlines in March: What you need to know",
        "As the financial year draws to a close, individuals and investors must stay updated on changes and deadlines that take effect in March. From tax filings to UPI payment rules, here\u2019s what you need to know to make informed financial decisions.\nUpdated ITR (ITR-U) filing deadline | If you made errors in your previous Income Tax Return (ITR) or missed reporting income, you can still rectify it by filing an updated return (ITR-U). The deadline for filing an updated ITR for FY2022-23 is March 31, 2025. Missing this deadline means losing the opportunity to correct errors and report omitted income.\nTax-saving investments | For taxpayers, March 31, 2025, is the last date to invest and claim deductions. Key deductions under the Income Tax Act include: Section 80C: Investments in PPF, ELSS, NSC, and life insurance premiums (limit of \u20b91.5 lakh per year);\u00a0 Section 80D: Health insurance premium deductions; Section 24(b): Home loan interest deductions; NPS Contributions (80CCD(1B)): Additional \u20b950,000 deduction. Missing the deadline could result in higher tax liabilities for those following the old tax regime.\nUAN activation for EPFO members | Employees under the Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) must activate their Universal Account Number (UAN) by March 15, 2025, to avail of insurance benefits under the Employees\u2019 Deposit Linked Insurance (EDLI) scheme. The scheme offers insurance coverage of up to \u20b97 lakh for EPF members. If UAN activation is pending, members risk losing insurance benefits.\nNew nomination rules for mutual funds and demat accounts | Effective March 1, 2025 SEBI has revised nomination rules for mutual funds and demat accounts to ensure a smooth transfer of assets. Key changes include: Investors can nominate up to 10 individuals. Nomination is mandatory for single-holder accounts to prevent unclaimed assets. Required nominee details include PAN, last four digits of Aadhaar, or a driving license number. Investors must provide the nominee\u2019s contact details, relationship with the account holder, and date of birth (if the nominee is a minor). For joint accounts, assets will transfer automatically to the surviving account holder under the survivorship rule.\nUPI payment rule change for insurance premiums | UPI users will be able to pay insurance premiums using blocked amounts under the Bima-ASBA facility. This feature will ensure that policyholders' funds remain blocked until the insurer accepts the policy proposal. If the insurer rejects the proposal, the blocked amount will be automatically unblocked. This move will be available this month."

        "What is D-Remit in National Pension System?",
        "D-Remit, a crucial feature in the National Pension System (NPS), \u00a0allows subscribers to transfer funds from one NPS account to another seamlessly. This facility helps in simplifying the process for subscribers who wish to move their accumulated funds between different pension accounts. D-Remit is primarily designed for those who switch jobs, change locations, or opt for a different pension fund manager.\nSimplifying Fund Transfers for Subscribers\nD-Remit enables subscribers to seamlessly transfer their accumulated NPS funds without any disruptions. This eliminates the need for the traditional, cumbersome process that once required manual paperwork and involved multiple steps. The feature is intended to ensure continuity in retirement savings, which is crucial for individuals who frequently change jobs or relocate across the country.\nBenefits of D-Remit\nHow D-Remit Works\nUnder D-Remit, subscribers can request a transfer of funds from one NPS account to another through their current NPS account holder or the new account manager. This system reduces the complications involved in manual transfer requests and offers a more streamlined process. Subscribers simply need to initiate the transfer from their online account, making the process far more accessible and convenient.\nRole in NPS Growth and Accessibility\nD-Remit is seen as an important step towards increasing the flexibility and reach of NPS, especially for those working in the private sector or frequently moving across different geographical locations. By simplifying the transfer process, it encourages individuals to invest in NPS with more confidence, knowing that their retirement savings will not be hindered due to job or location changes.\nIn recent years, the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA)\u00a0has been working on several initiatives to make NPS more accessible, with D-Remit being one of the key steps in improving subscriber experience. The system is expected to make it easier for new and existing subscribers to stay enrolled in NPS, improving overall participation in the scheme."

        "Modi goes on Gir safari, spotlights Asiatic lion revival, and renews wildlife conservation pledge",
        "Prime Minister Narendra Modi took a lion safari at Gir Wildlife Sanctuary on World Wildlife Day, highlighting India's efforts to protect Asiatic lions and promote biodiversity conservation.\nModi Starts Safari: Prime Minister Narendra Modi kicked off a lion safari at Gir Wildlife Sanctuary in Gujarat on March 3, 2025, aligning with World Wildlife Day. His visit to the state included this special outing to spotlight conservation efforts. He started early Monday morning, driving through the sanctuary to observe its wildlife.\nSafari Location Details: The safari took place at Gir Wildlife Sanctuary, situated in Gujarat\u2019s Junagadh district, a region famous for its Asiatic lions. This sanctuary serves as a critical habitat for these animals, and Modi\u2019s visit aimed to raise awareness about their preservation.\nOfficials Join Tour: Modi was joined by several ministers and senior forest department officials during the jeep safari at Gir Wildlife Sanctuary. They travelled together through the rugged terrain, observing the lions in their natural environment. Modi took photographs of the animals, capturing their movements and surroundings.\nCommitment to Biodiversity: On World Wildlife Day, Modi renewed his promise to protect the planet\u2019s biodiversity, sharing his thoughts via a post on X. He wrote, \"Today, on #WorldWildlifeDay, let's reiterate our commitment to protect and preserve the incredible biodiversity of our planet.\" He also attached a video showcasing his previous jungle safaris.\nFocus on Species Role: Modi stressed the importance of every species in sustaining ecological balance, a point he made clear in his X post. He stated, \"Every species plays a vital role -- let's safeguard their future for generations to come!\" This call to action aimed to ensure wildlife thrives for years ahead. His words encouraged people to value all forms of life, linking their survival to the health of the planet.\nIndia\u2019s Conservation Efforts: Modi also praised India\u2019s work in wildlife protection during his World Wildlife Day statement. He wrote on X, \"We also take pride in India's contributions towards preserving and protecting wildlife.\" This highlighted national initiatives that have bolstered conservation across the country. He pointed to efforts like habitat restoration and species monitoring as examples of India\u2019s commitment.\nWildlife Board Meeting: At Sasan Gir, the administrative hub of Gir Wildlife Sanctuary, Modi chaired the seventh meeting of the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL) on 3 March 2025. This body, with 47 members, includes representatives from various states, NGOs, and the Chief of Army Staff. They gathered to review and plan strategies for wildlife conservation nationwide.\nProject Lion Explained: The central government introduced Project Lion to safeguard Asiatic lions, which live only in Gujarat. This initiative focuses on restoring lion habitats, engaging local communities in conservation, and advancing research on big cat diseases.\nLion Numbers Grow: The population of Asiatic lions in Gujarat has risen steadily, according to official counts. Numbers grew from 411 in 2010 to 523 in 2015, reaching 674 by June 2020. Their habitat expanded too, from 22,000 square kilometres in 2015 to 30,000 square kilometres in 2020.\nMeeting Forest Staff: After the NBWL meeting, Modi met with women forest staffers at Sasan on 3 March 2025. This took place following his lion safari and a review of Project Lion\u2019s progress. The interaction recognised the vital role these workers play in protecting the sanctuary\u2019s wildlife.\nTemple Prayers: On Sunday, 2 March 2025, Modi visited Somnath temple in Gujarat to offer prayers. This site, revered as the first of 12 Jyotirlingas, holds deep spiritual significance. After the visit, he travelled to Sasan and stayed overnight at Sinh Sadan, a forest guest house managed by the state."

        "Essential items to buy for Holi: A complete shopping list for the festival of colours",
        "Holi, the festival of colours, is one of India's most treasured celebrations. It signifies the victory of good over evil, the approach of spring, and the delight of community. As Holi 2025 approaches, it's time to start organising and collecting the necessary items for a safe and joyful celebration.\nNatural Colours |\u00a0Colours are the heart of Holi, and no Holi celebration is complete without a variety of vibrant colours. It is wise to choose natural and organic colours that are safer for your skin and your health as well as better for the environment. (Image: Shutterstock)\nTraditional Gulal |\u00a0It is a finely powdered pigment, a customary and necessary component of Holi. It is often applied to cheeks and foreheads as a blessing and well-wishes symbol. One can choose fruit-based gulal and bright body paints to bring excitement and fun to the festivities. (Image: Shutterstock)\nPichkaris or Water Guns |\u00a0For children in particular, pichkaris are an essential component of the Holi celebration. Pichkaris come in a variety of sizes to suit every age and taste, from tiny handheld models to massive super soakers. (Image: Shutterstock)\nWater Balloons |\u00a0People of all ages love water balloons, and they are ideal for fun water fights. They are a traditional Holi necessity that enhances the celebrations with an aspect of surprise and excitement. Water balloons are a great way to cool off and inject some fun into the Holi festivities. (Image: Reuters)\nSkincare and Haircare Products| Skin and hair damage may result from the usage of chemicals in Holi colouring. One can use natural products to protect themselves, such as coconut oil, which nourishes the skin and hair and acts as a barrier against colours. (Image: Reuters)\nSweets and Chocolates | Holi specialities like sweets and gujias are the epitome of sweetness and unity. Moreover, they offer a multitude of choices to the people. (Image: Shutterstock)\nHoli Refreshments | Holi parties are incomplete without cool beverages to keep people energised during the celebrations. The traditional Holi beverage Thandai is a must-have for bringing tradition and taste to your festivities. (Image: Shutterstock)\nHoli Gift Hampers |\u00a0Holi is a time to promote happiness and love while giving innovative gift baskets to loved ones. People can present personalised gift baskets filled with essentials like chocolates, candies, and new clothes. (Image: Shutterstock)\nTraditional Ritual Items | A significant custom during Holi is Holika Dahan puja. Eco-friendly materials such as kande and cow dung logs enable individuals to perform this ceremony responsibly while protecting the environment. (Image: PTI)"

        "The famous saying \u201cdil walon ki dilli\u201d just got real when the Internet discovered a gem at the heart of the \u2018city! In a world where people are charged heavily for even the bare minimum facilities, airports charge extraordinary prices for a cup of coffee and corporations are capitalizing on last-minute convenience needs and earning millions, this cab driver is offering more facilities than a flight. But that\u2019s not it \u2013 everything that you will see in his car is absolutely free!\nIn a recent Reddit post on r/Delhi, a user shared his experience when he boarded a cab that looked no less than a convenience store. Comparing it with flights, he captioned the above image with \u201cFound cab facilities better than flights\u2026\u201d and soon the post gained attraction with more than 7k likes and users sharing their own experiences with this generous driver.\nThe comments also identified the driver as Abdul Qadir, who has been covered by newspapers as the \u201cUber driver who\u2019s never cancelled on his customers\u201d.

        "Why The TikTok Trend \u2018Girl Math, Girl Dinner\u2019 Is Momentous For Women Everywhere",
        "If we try to get to the bottom of why mansplaining and manspreading are problematic behaviours (apart from the obvious reasons of course), it all comes down to one thing; Women have been discouraged from taking up space physically, psychologically and intellectually, for decades.\nTo be honest, we\u2019ve only scratched the surface by calling out manspreading and mansplaining. Intellectually and psychologically, women are still, often, expected to retreat into corners and not express their authentic selves. Why am I saying this? Am I a pessimist? Am I a misandrist? Am I a bitter, single woman, who can\u2019t help but look for a chance to portray women as victims?\nI think I am just a woman who\u2019s tired of seeing women being taken as jokes. Let\u2019s take for instance, this TikTok trend that has taken the world by a storm \u2013 the \u2018Girl Dinner, Girl Math\u2019 trend. Women from all over the world are sharing how they manage their finances and what they eat for dinner under these hashtags. But it\u2019s not just this, the idea behind \u2018Girl Dinner,\u2019 is to discuss the things we women eat when we\u2019re at ease, when we feel like we\u2019re exempt from the judgement of society, of patriarchy, of certain men who may look at our food, give it a disapproving frown and call it \u2018unhealthy.\u2019\n\u2018Girl Dinners\u2019 are about throwing together easy-to-make meals that may even be described as lazy work. And the truth is, that\u2019s the point. We want to be able to do something for our enjoyment, for the nourishment of our taste-buds and bodies without hearing critical comments that most women have grown up hearing. Comments such as, \u2018Wow, you\u2019re such a bad cook.\u2019 Or, \u2018No wonder you\u2019re single, you can\u2019t even cook a proper meal to feed yourself, how will you ever be able to cook for your partner, or children?\u2019\nThe truth is that women are exhausted by trying to be good at things, so that they can serve the people around them. We\u2019d like to be able to make an easy meal without someone telling us we need to \u2018Be better, do better.\u2019\nAnd we also understand that this isn\u2019t an excuse to neglect your health and opt for unhealthy food, this trend is not an invitation to glorify poor eating habits. Rather, it\u2019s an invitation to make peace with the fact that sometimes it\u2019s okay to do the bare minimum. Sometimes, you deserve to give yourself ease, sometimes you deserve to give yourself the permission to be laid back.\nNow, the same applies to the \u2018Girl Math\u2019 trend. It\u2019s not leeway to manage personal finances terribly. It\u2019s an invitation to give yourself the freedom to take ownership of your hard-earned money. \u2018Girl Math\u2019 is about us women handling our finances with a sense of autonomy that may not resonate with people who are conditioned to understand money through the lens of patriarchy.\nBut, if I were to simplify it, I\u2019d best describe it as spending money in a way that has earned you time to save your finances, has earned you the opportunity to extract full use of a high-end product, or spending money in a way where your savings aren\u2019t being impacted.\nSo, though these trends may seem like frivolous little habits that many women may navigate their life with, they\u2019re actually strategic long-term thought processes, that we\u2019re mostly conscious of. And whatever little content that you do see under these hashtags that seems bizarre, is most probably satire that us women have conjured up to joke about our less-than-perfect habits. Because, maybe, just maybe, we know how to not take ourselves so seriously!\nThe truth is that these trends have given hundreds of women the space to be imperfect. Maybe it\u2019s just a silly little trend, but it\u2019s also virtual breathing space for women."

        "Two Wheels, One Epic Adventure: A Breathtaking Ride Through Northeast India",
        "Adventure has always been my calling, and my love for off-roading recently took me on an unforgettable journey to Northeast India. Riding my brand-new Royal Enfield Himalayan 450, I embarked on a 14-day expedition with 25 complete strangers, all from different walks of life. It felt like a real-life Roadies experience, minus the drama and the vote-outs!\nAs I navigated the breathtaking trails of the Northeast, my bike proved to be the perfect companion. The powerful pick-up and smooth handling made even the toughest off-road terrains feel like a knife slicing through butter. This magical adventure kicked off in Guwahati, Assam, known as the Gateway to the Northeast. Little did I know, the journey ahead would be one of the most exhilarating rides of my life.\nRiding into Cherrapunji from Guwahati on my bike, a wave of nostalgia hit me. Suddenly, all those geography lessons from school came rushing back, about Cherrapunji being the wettest place on Earth (now the second). And true to its reputation, Meghalaya lived up to its name, which means \u201cthe abode of clouds\u201d.\nThe weather was as unpredictable as the journey itself. One moment, I was drenched in sweat from the humid heat, and the next, the clouds soaked us completely with rain. But that\u2019s the magic of Meghalaya \u2013 you don\u2019t just see the beauty, you feel it. After getting lost in the magic of Meghalaya we headed back to Shillong to enjoy local delicacies like a traditional rice dish called jadoh, barbeque pork, etc. And then, we explored the bustling Police Bazaar for shopping.\nThe next day\u2019s ride was smooth and effortless, thanks to my trusty Himalayan 450. Our destination? The Living Root Bridge \u2013 a bridge not built by humans but grown by nature itself. The roots of ancient trees have intertwined over time, forming a sturdy connection across the river. Walking across it felt surreal, as if stepping onto a masterpiece crafted by nature\u2019s own hands.\nIt was time to head back to Assam and explore its wildlife wonders. Leaving the mountains behind, we hit the open plains, and riding at 150 km/h on a straight highway, I had a realisation, if the bike was the beast, then I was the beauty, and this beast had my back. Reaching Kaziranga National Park, we set out on a safari, and to my shock, the first animal I spotted was a freaking tiger! Watching it move gracefully from a safe distance was a dream come true for a cat lover like me. As we explored further, we encountered the majestic one-horned rhino, deer, monitor lizards, wild buffalo, and more.\nOur next stop was Majuli, a unique island in the middle of the Brahmaputra River. Getting there was an adventure in itself, we rode to the ferry point, carefully loaded our bikes onto the ferry, and set off towards the island. Once we arrived, we were welcomed with the vibrant Bihu dance and got a taste of their local rice beer, Apong. And let me tell you \u2013 it was one hell of an experience!\nThis was something I had been most excited about,- heading to Ziro in Arunachal Pradesh. It was my first time there, and every second was worth it! The lush greenery, the cool temperature, the warm people, and even the surprisingly cheap alcohol (cheaper than Goa!) made it an unforgettable experience. We visited the Apatani Tribe\u2019s homes and their paddy fields, where elderly Apatani women sang and danced in their local language called Tani. I had always wanted to visit Ziro for its famous music festival, but this was something else: peaceful, grounding, and deeply soulful.\nOn Day 7, we took a pit stop at Nameri National Park before heading to Dirang, as it was a long journey. But what awaited us on Day 8 was truly something special.\nThis ride to Dirang was where we witnessed the real beauty of Arunachal Pradesh, spotting Mithuns (large domestic cattle) and yaks casually roaming around, animals you don\u2019t get to see in everyday life. The most surreal part? Riding through the clouds, feeling the cool moisture and the gentle rain they carried.\nThis was by far one of the most adventurous rides of the entire trip. After crossing the Sela Tunnel, we witnessed a frozen waterfall, a sight straight out of a dream. But while I once thought my boss was my biggest enemy, I quickly realized the real one was black ice, making the ride dangerously slippery. Thankfully, my bike made it easier as its suspension and tire grip gave me the confidence to push through safely. Reaching Tawang was a spiritual experience, and I felt incredibly lucky to be there during the festival season.\nAfter Tawang, we wrapped up our journey, heading back to Guwahati. And let me tell you, throughout this entire trip, it was my bike that gave me the confidence to ride through it all.

        "10 People Who Have Worked For The Ambani Family Reveal What\u2019s It Like Being Employed By Them",
        "The lives of the rich are often hidden from plebians like us. We can only fathom what they live like and how they go about their daily lives. So when we found this Reddit thread on the Mumbai subreddit where people who have worked in Mukesh Ambani\u2019s Antilia shared their experiences, it felt like we were close to unravelling a mystery. The responses people shared are unexpectedly enlightening.\nLet\u2019s take a look, shall we?\n1. \u201cWe are expecting a work order soon. Regarding pay, they are good paymasters; provided that you have all your documents and stuff and compliance as per their norms.\u201d \u2013 mohattar\n2. \u201cA friend used to work for them and I heard this from her. Apparently, Nita Ambani sleeps in the morning/noon and wakes up late in the night and that\u2019s when their day starts. All meetings with her used to be at 12 midnight or 1 AM and stuff. I\u2019ve heard from someone who works with their cousins that they\u2019re very particular about watching a movie together every night as a family. Cute.\u201d \u2013 Legitimate-Work5329\n3. \u201cBack when I was a hospitality student, I got to work in Antilia for an event. We were paid \u20b92500 for a six-hour shift and it was a three-day event. We didn\u2019t have to do much, just had to serve almonds, ice creams, appetizers, juices, etc. to guests. Their criteria, however, was very intricate. We had to undergo a full body checkup and COVID tests. They even put us in a hotel nearby for a week before the event as quarantine.\u201d \u2013 archieshahh\n4. \u201cWe had this building security guard a few months back. His elder brother used to/still working at Antilia in the admin department. They\u2019re good paymasters and also very generous in terms of helping the people working for them.\u201d \u2013 RareTranslator1047\nCheck Out \u2013 Indian luxury brands\n5. \u201cMost of the year, they do not live there. They are either travelling or are at their UK home, only the elder son and his wife are at Antilia.

They usually showed up late, often taking hours to come.\u201d \u2013 Scientifichuman\n8. \u201cA friend of mine interned at a company which supplied motors for water. Once he went in there with a senior for maintenance, his job was to see and learn. One thing he told me was that they applied stickers to his camera, which change colours when removed. It was pre-covid, so it was apparently smooth for him.\u201d \u2013 sunny9911\n9. \u201cMy ex-boss worked for MDA (Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani \u2013 his team addressed him that). He told us that he behaves like an absolutely normal person who orders bhelpuri or idlis or vadapav during team meetings. He regularly attends his office strictly on time. Of course, he is not easily accessible. But many times, MDA can be seen standing in the queue for lunch at the Reliance canteen at Navi Mumbai. Needless to say, all the canteens serve the best possible vegetarian spread in a highly neat and clean environment.\u201d \u2013 Electronic-Bill-264\n10. \u201cNeeta Ambani is very sweet and loves her kids.

        "Podcast Host\u2019s Rant About North Indian Tourists In Vietnam Has The Internet Screaming \u2018Stereotype Alert\u2019",
        "A podcast host has stirred the pot on social media after sharing his less-than-pleasant encounters with North Indian tourists during his New Year trip to Vietnam.\nRavi Handa, the host of Desi FIRE Podcast, accused them of \u201cruining\u201d his travel experience, sparking a flurry of reactions online.\nRavi Handa kicked off the conversation by explaining why he skipped Goa for his New Year\u2019s getaway. \u201cGoa has too many North Indian tourists, and they ruin the experience,\u201d he said, choosing Vietnam instead. But to his dismay, he encountered what he described as \u201cbad behaviour\u201d from Indian tourists there as well.\nI went to Vietnam for the new year break, and Goa was a choice. But not for the reasons any of you people on twitter go bonkers about. Goa has too many North Indian tourists and they ruin the experience. Even in Vietnam, the only bad behavior was from North Indian tourists.\u2026 https://t.co/CHiZeVRgoT\nFrom cutting lines with excuses like \u201cHum logon ke pass special pass hai\u201d to shouting Bharat Mata Ki Jai in a crowded train, Handa claimed the loud antics were mostly from North Indians. \u201cI even stopped one at the cable car line,\u201d he added, \u201cbut arguing seemed pointless.\u201d\nNaturally, Twitter took sides faster than a tea-seller at an Indo-Pak match. Many users lashed out at Handa for stereotyping North Indians, calling his remarks \u201cracist.\u201d\n\u201cHow did you know they were North Indians?\u201d asked one user, to which Handa replied that the tourists explicitly mentioned being from NCR. Another user pointed out, \u201cThis mentality of dividing North, South, East, and West is why we can\u2019t progress as a society.\u201d\nUber racist comment \ud83e\udd2eHow did you know that misbehaving tourists were North India?You can tell everything about a person by looking at him \ud83e\udd2d\nWhile Handa\u2019s comments did raise eyebrows, they also found some support. Many North Indians chimed in, admitting they\u2019ve witnessed similar behaviour. \u201cMe, being a North Indian myself, always felt ashamed, but now it\u2019s a whole new level of shame!\u201d wrote one user.\nYep. We have to agree that we Indians don't have civics sense (including me). We need to improve. And more people coming out on SM is one such way to nudge us to improve.\nAnother added, \u201cThere was a group of North Indians on a train in Europe, making too much noise in the name of \u2018having a good time.\u2019 All the other Europeans were silent, and only these people were shouting.\u201d\nThe debate has reignited conversations about travel etiquette and the stereotypes associated with Indian tourists abroad. While some argue that bad behaviour knows no region, others believe it\u2019s time to introspect and, well, turn the volume down a notch.\nSo, what do you think? Are these stereotypes justified, or are we simply dividing ourselves further? Let us know in the comments, but, you know, quietly."

        "Here\u2019s How Much People In My Office Are Spending On Quick Commerce Apps and I Feel Like A Noob!",
        "A few days back, I shared my experience on the internet about how I spent 30k on online delivery apps in the span of 8 months and how the apps made me lazier than I was since everything was at my fingertips. I tried to point out how subconsciously these apps and their instant gratification have changed our consumption patterns so much, that we are prioritizing quick delivery over health. The internet\u2019s reaction was very interesting. Some of them were very quick to point out that convenience wasn\u2019t the problem, but my laziness and bad habits were (as if I didn\u2019t know).\nA post shared by Instagram (@instagram)\nHowever, some of them commented that my numbers were \u201crookie\u201d and that I needed to bump them up! Well, that got me thinking \u2013 how much are people actually spending on these online delivery apps? And I decided to go on a little survey in my office and it turns out, people are spending a considerable amount of money that I couldn\u2019t even have thought of.\nDuring the survey, I asked them to add all the money that they have spent on quick commerce apps like Zomato, Swiggy, Blinkit, BigBasket, Zepto, or anything that they used for groceries and supplies for the month of December. Most of them relied on these apps for groceries, but when they calculated, they themselves were shocked at how much they actually spent even if it was on essentials. Some of them agreed that it promoted unhealthy habits and they might get it cheaper if they purchased it at local stores. Take a look for yourself:\nWell, for sure I am a noob when it comes to these online spending patterns.\nPlease note that these numbers are a representation of how dependent the respondents are on these online apps and don\u2019t reveal their eating habits or ordering patterns."

        "Netizens Share Price Differences On Delivery Apps For iOS & Android And We Are Shocked!",
        "Delivery apps are a lifeline for many of us, especially those with the busiest schedules. Whether you forget someone\u2019s gift, want groceries, or need midnight snacks, these delivery apps have made everything just one click away. However, this world of convenience isn\u2019t as perfect as it seems. As more and more users are now adopting this quick commerce lifestyle, they can\u2019t help but notice some particular patterns \u2013 which are not ethical per se.\nWell, if you have ever compared notes with your friends and realized that your groceries or delivery bills on these apps don\u2019t really match, you are not alone. Recently a lot of netizens have shared their experiences on social media platforms about dark patterns that these apps have adopted. But a particular one in highlight is the price difference for iOS and Android. Users have spotted slightly (and sometimes considerably high) prices of the same groceries when ordered from the same location at the same time. The only difference is their phone model.\nThis has resulted in a lot of questions, including \u2013 are apps charging us differently based on the device we use? Because it looks like they are. Recently, Vinita Singh from LinkedIn shared her experience when she discovered that capsicums were priced at a huge difference on Zepto for an Android and iOS phone.\nThe Android phone showed the difference to be Rs. 21, whereas the iPhone showed it to be almost Rs. 107. A whopping difference of Rs. 86. The users shared their experiences in the comment section. While one user commented \u201ciPhone leke ghumte ho kharcha to hoga na\u201d, one user justified the difference as: \u201c(more)\u2026.. Apple is charging $965 more than Google to keep your app published. So, companies have to find a way to manage this cost, and I guess the users, for whom companies need to pay this amount, should be the best source to manage this extra cost.\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t just an isolated incident. Multiple users have complained about the dynamic pricing between iPhone and Android users. Take a look:\nHey @ZeptoNow , I understand that I\u2019m using an iPhone, but that doesn\u2019t mean I can afford to pay more than Android users for the same product. We\u2019ve already paid our taxes please don\u2019t loot us again @jagograhakjago @BandBajaateRaho pic.twitter.com/IUfW3lP83v\nAndroid vs iPhone comparison Same Location, Same Product App : Zepto @ZeptoNow Paneer on Android : \u20b9 116Paneer on iPhone : \u20b9 139Soyarich Tofu on Android : \u20b9 59Soyarich Tofu on iPhone : \u20b9 75Why this much difference for many products? #Zepto #ZeptoNow 1/2.. pic.twitter.com/sNwHUXTCOC\nPrice difference in iPhone and Android.

This one is a bit tricky:\u2013 They have stopped showing the amount total effective price breakdown\u2013 Discounted prices of goods added don\u2019t match up to the totalcontinued \ud83d\udd3b pic.twitter.com/BlCKNVvhTY\nWell, it isn\u2019t just online delivery apps, but other service-based apps like Uber as well. Users have shared how Uber has also presented dynamic planning for different models of phones.\nSame pickup point, destination & time but 2 different phones get 2 different rates. It happens with me as I always get higher rates on my Uber as compared to my daughter\u2019s phone. So most of the time, I request her to book my Uber. Does this happen with you also? What is the hack? pic.twitter.com/bFqMT0zZpW\n@Uber_India  what logic you use to price your rides is obviously out of my understanding. Could you care to explain for us?Same spot, same time, same distance but different phone and price difference is 110Rs.WHY??#Bengaluru pic.twitter.com/uv7J0IbnLJ\n@Uber_India what are you guys smoking?This is the fare difference between a oneplus 11r and iPhone 14.Android is showing more price?? Any reason? pic.twitter.com/v5L9S9oP70\nThe next time you open your favorite quick commerce app, take a moment to consider what\u2019s happening behind the scenes. Are you paying a premium because of your phone? Is the app quietly tweaking fees based on assumptions about your spending habits?\nWhile these price differences may seem small, they raise bigger questions about fairness, transparency, and how much control we really have as consumers."

        "Indian celebrity weddings are often synonymous with grandeur, extravagant venues, designer outfits, and a star-studded guest list. However, industrialist Gautam Adani took a different approach for his son Jeet Adani\u2019s wedding, opting for simplicity over a grand spectacle.\nJeet Adani tied the knot with Diva Jaimin Shah in an intimate ceremony on February 7, 2025, at the Adani township, Shantigram, in Ahmedabad. The wedding, held at 2 PM, followed traditional Jain and Gujarati customs. Contrary to speculations of a lavish celebration, the Adani family chose a simple wedding, attended only by close friends and family.\nIn a remarkable gesture, the family not only embraced simplicity but also contributed significantly to social causes.

        "People Share Toxic Things In Desi Culture That Are Normalized & There\u2019s So Much We Are Doing Wrong",
        "There\u2019s always a lot to love about places that we come from, they\u2019re home after all. This means that even our culture is something that we deeply love, despite the flaws; and there\u2019s no denying that there are a lot of flaws. So much of the desi culture boils down to pretending that we are better than the rest, it\u2019s as if we are constantly competing. A lot of our ideas and opinions are problematic in ways that they harm all of us. Yet, we don\u2019t let them go.\nSome people shared similar instances and ideas of our culture that are deeply toxic:\n1. \u201cThe idea that we have to respect people who are older than us \u2013 relatives and family members, solely because they\u2019re older in age. When in fact, the basis for respect should be an individual\u2019s personality \u2013 it should depend on how they are as human beings.\u201d\n\u2013 Anonymous\n2. \u201cYou cannot have a male friend without the family assuming that you\u2019re in a relationship. This is especially true for women, their friendships with men are ruined because of this regressive mindset.\n\u2013 Aaliyah Jain\n3. \u201cPeople think that there\u2019s a specific age bar to get married. So, anytime you reach anywhere nearer that age, relatives and family members start pestering you. This is pressuring and wrong.\u201d\n\u2013 Naman Issar\n4. \u201cSo many parents make it a point to show that they\u2019re doing a favour when they\u2019re there for the children. Most things they do, they do it as an obligation. The mentality that raising a child is a favour is so toxic \u2013 it\u2019s a choice. Children should not be shown that they owe their parents something because they chose to raise a child.\u201d\n\u2013 Manya\n5. \u201cOur society spends too much money on weddings. This is mostly done to show off \u2013 and it\u2019s problematic. In some cases, people start saving money for the women\u2019s wedding when they\u2019re kids. All of this for someone else, when this money could actually be used for the kids\u2019 future or as an investment.\n\u2013 Izhan Saifi\n6. \u201cGossiping is neither normal, nor okay. I don\u2019t understand why desi culture has normalized it.\u201d\n\u2013 Shantanu Ghosh\n7. \u201cThe idea that parents\u2019 love is unconditional, is flawed. They say that they\u2019ll love us for who we are, despite everything. However, it mostly comes down to their terms. They love us when we live on their terms, when we make them happy by doing things they like. They don\u2019t love us for who we are.\u201d\n\u2013 Anonymous\n8. \u201cWe can hardly take other people doing well. Everything is a competition with us, and we only feel like we are successful when other people around us aren\u2019t doing better than us. I\u2019ve hardly seen people being genuinely happy for someone else\u2019s success. This competition is ingrained in our mentality.\u201d\n\u2013 Riya Gill\n9. \u201cWe\u2019re so into pleasing others, and looking a certain way that we don\u2019t even leave situations like a death of someone close. Our rituals and the idea of having to serve \u201cgood food\u201d are deeply toxic.\u201d\n\u2013 Harshit Ailawadi\n\n10. \u201cYou\u2019re expected to follow the guidance of your elder siblings out of respect. However, sometimes that can end up having an adverse affect, especially if the siblings are either narcissistic or abusive.\u201d\n\u2013 Harshita Singh\nA lot to think about, and correct."

        "Old pictures \u2013 the closest thing we have perhaps to a time machine. You must have once sat beside your parents when they discovered their batch photos from their class WhatsApp group and couldn\u2019t stop talking about it. They must have given you a description of everyone from that picture, who was in their close circle, had a crush on them (they seldom tell you who they had a crush on), with whom they picked a fight once, and who became an over-achiever against all odds.\nHowever, there are some batches where the students beat the law of averages and a majority of them go on to do extremely well in life. One such group of people can be seen in a picture that has been recently going viral on the internet. You can see stellar actors like Jaideep Ahlawat, Rajkummar Rao, Vijay Varma, and Sunny Hinduja posing for a picture from their FTII days in 2005. They were all part of the acting program.\nIt's actually insane that:Jaideep Ahlawat, Rajkummar Rao, Vijay Varma and Sunny Hinduja were part of the same FTII batch of 2005. pic.twitter.com/kt8FLNNirO\nWith his recently released Paatal Lok Season 2, Jaideep has again proved why he is considered a generational talent. His outstanding performances in movies like Raazi, Three of Us, An Action Hero, and Jaane Jaan further add to his case. From Shahid to Stree, from Citylights to Newton, Rajkummar has a diverse range of roles that many can only dream of.\nVijay Varma\u2019s breakthrough role came in Gully Boy, and since then there\u2019s no stopping him with films and shows like Darlings, Dahaad, IC 814: The Kandahar Hijack. Our beloved Sandeep Bhaiya aka Sunny Hinduja has been a heartthrob in the OTT space with The Family Man, Chacha Vidhayak Hain Humare, and Aspirants.\nThe internet was pleasantly surprised to see that so many talented actors once trained in the same classroom.\nRajkumar, Jaideep and Vijay were together in Chittagong. Wow.\nUs saal ke teacher ko Padmashri diya jaaye\nVijay still looks same\nHoly shit what a batch\nToo much Talent in one frame\n\n\nHowever, these four are not the only ones who have been successful stars from their batch. Sunny had revealed in an interview from 2023 about the other members from their batch.\nThis includes, among many others, Sunny\u2019s wife Shinjini Raval (known for Delhi Belly, Aranyak, and Peddlers).  Their batch also had Jaswant Dalal (NH 10, Farzi), Varun Verma (Rustom), and Nayani Dixit (Delhi Belly, Special 26, Queen). We found a list of all the students from the batch of 2005 from ftiipeople.com.\nWhat a great feeling it must be for this talented bunch to be reliving their college nostalgia with their current co-workers!"

        "7 Couple-Friendly Hotel Chains That Won\u2019t Judge You For Being With Your Partner",
        "If you like to travel with your partner, you probably know how difficult finding an accommodation at hotels gets. The process is frustrating, and people definitely don\u2019t make it easy. There are hardly any major chains that allow unmarried couples to book a room together. This, of course, stems from the regressive mindset of our society. However, not being able to book a room at a trustworthy group also means an unsafe experience. So, this is a more important issue than we give it credit for.\nKeeping that in mind, we have made a list of hotel chains that won\u2019t judge you for being with your partner.\n1. Stay Uncle\nThe platform offers hotel booking services with a focus on providing safe and comfortable accommodations for couples in India. The chain even insists at creating a sex-positive space, which is free of judgement. In doing that, it promotes a safe stay for couples who aren\u2019t married. Stay Uncle has hotels in over 40 cities, and it\u2019s ever expanding.\n2. FabHotels\nFabHotels is another chain that is couple-friendly. The hotel group is safe for couples who are unmarried and offers a reliable stay. The booking process is quite simple for this one, so its accessibility is better than a lot of similar chains. There are a list of hotels in different Indian cities, which helps with accommodation when you\u2019re travelling for leisure.\n3. OYO Rooms\nOYO Rooms is probably one of the most known chains when it comes to hotel stay that is safe and easy for couples who are unmarried. The good part about most of the hotels under the chain is that they are affordable \u2013 this increases the accessibility which a lot of hotel chains lack.\n4. Brevistay\nBrevistay has short-stay accommodations, primarily for couples and travelers looking for flexible booking options. The chain offers a number of options in terms of budget, location, and amenities. To make the entire stay and process more comfortable, they have flexible check-in and check-out timings. So, it\u2019s the customers who have control over their stay, and not the other way round.\n5. Mistay\nThis is also a hotel booking platform with flexible check-in and check-out timings. This means that MiStay specializes in enabling travelers, especially couples to reserve hotel rooms for precise timeframes. This makes it perfect for brief stays, stopovers, and different lodging needs. According to the platform, the options are affordable, so booking a hotel with the platform does not come with a significant financial burden.\n6. LuvStay\nLuvStay is known for being couple-friendly and aims to create a comfortable and non-judgmental environment for unmarried couples. The booking platform also offers an app which makes the process simpler. The chain is said to be one of the groups that has finally come up with safe and secure living situations for couples who are unmarried.\n7. Treebo Hotels\nWhile the group had initially started as a hotel chain for travellers, it also included couple friendly hotels under the name. The idea behind the hotel chain\u2019s step is that moral policing often ruins vacation or travel experience for couples who aren\u2019t married. There are hotels in different cities, so that\u2019s another plus.\nWhile nothing changes how unmarried couples are treated for living together in our society, this is the bare minimum that can help."

        "Elon Musk might have achieved several feats throughout his career, however, it is essential to step away from worshipping him like a hero and examine his actions. It is now high time to assess the man behind the massive headlines and discuss the reality.\nIn the list below, we have mentioned some compelling reasons why people should stop treating this business magnate like a hero. Read on.\n1. He\u2019s a man-child.\nFrom changing its name and charging $8 per month for blue ticks to changing the iconic blue bird to the viral doge, the man has made a joke of his micro-blogging website, Twitter. Recently, the man shared a private picture of his ex, Amber Heard, dressed as a video game character. I mean how childish and ridiculous a man can get?\n2. He has made some very insensitive statements.\nThe man, on several occasions, has said some heartless things. In 2020, he called the people \u2018dumb\u2019 to worry about the deadly coronavirus. In 2022, when Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, he came up with a bizarre list of suggestions to solve the war, through an insensitive poll on Twitter.\n3. He\u2019s sexist and homophobic.\nNeedless to mention, he also has a terrible sense of humor. In 2021, he proposed opening a school called the Texas Institute Of Technology & Science. To this, a person suggested swapping the words \u2018technology\u2019 and \u2018science\u2019. The magnate declined and said that he wanted the name to begin with the letter T \u2013 that\u2019s because the school\u2019s name makes the acronym TITS. He has also made some homophobic statements over time and made fun of people for writing pronouns in their social media bios.\n4. He has no respect for his own employees.\nIt\u2019s 2023 and the man is still promoting the toxic hustle culture. Last year, in 2022, his employees received an ultimatum from him at two in the morning which stated that their work lives would look very different now. His email said that the employees can either commit to the new \u2018hardcore culture\u2019 or leave with three months\u2019 notice. In another instance, he laid off the janitors from his office and made the employees bring their own toilet paper. He also fired an engineer over his low reach on Twitter.\nIt\u2019s high time that we stop hailing a man-child like him as a hero!"

        "It has been five years since the world witnessed a global pandemic that caused seven million deaths globally. Recently, unverified videos of hospitals across China have emerged showing overcrowded emergency rooms due to the alleged spread of HMPV. The visuals, reminiscent of the early days of COVID-19 have raised global concerns, with panic among the masses.\nWhile there is no official information from the WHO regarding the cases, the internet is circulating with a lot of reports about the virus and its potential risk. Here is everything you need to know about the virus, its symptoms, transmission, treatments, prevention, and the current situation in India.\nAccording to the Cleveland Clinic, human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a virus causing symptoms similar to a cold. The cases are usually mild and children, those with weakened immune systems, and adults over the age of 65 face a higher risk of contracting such diseases. It was first identified in 2001 and generally causes both lower and upper respiratory tract infections.\nThe symptoms of HMPV are very similar to those of the common cold and include cough, fever, runny or stuffy nose, sore throat, wheezing, shortness of breath, and even rash. Severe cases can escalate to serious respiratory diseases pneumonia, asthma flare-ups, or make chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) worse, requiring medical intervention. The mild cases last for a few days or a week, whereas serious cases can last longer. People are more likely to get sick the first time, therefore children are at more risk. Later getting some immunity, they develop only mild symptoms if they the HMPV next time.\nThe spread of the virus occurs through respiratory droplets getting transferred through coughing or sneezing. It can also travel through close personal contact through handshakes or hugs or coming in direct contact with contaminated surfaces such as railings, handles, knobs, or washroom basins.\nThere aren\u2019t any antiviral medications that treat HMPV. Mild symptoms are usually manageable at home, however, serious complications require hospital admission and remain under constant care. No antibiotics have yet proven to treat HMPV, since it is a virus.\nThe transmission, however, can be prevented with care and precautions.\nAt the time of writing, India has officially reported two cases of HMPV in Bengaluru \u2013 a 3-month-old and an 8-month-old. However, the infants have no travel history. According to ICMR, \u201cIt is emphasized that HMPV is already in circulation globally, including in India, and cases of respiratory illnesses associated with HMPV have been reported in various countries.\u201d However, the top medical body also noted that India is well-equipped to handle any potential increase in illnesses. As of Friday, the Union Health Ministry also stated that it was closely monitoring the alleged outbreak of Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) in China."

        "Imagine spending \u20b950 lakh in a year on traveling and calling it a lifestyle shift. That\u2019s exactly what travel influencer Sharanya Iyer did, and naturally, the internet has opinions.\nIn a now-viral Instagram reel titled \u201cHow Much I Spent in 2024\u201d, Sharanya revealed her jaw-dropping expenses, breaking down how she managed to globe-trot across six countries, buy a brand-new car, and still keep a smile on her face.\nSharanya, who boasts a following of over 503K on Instagram, shared that she visited countries like Laos, Thailand, South Africa, Greenland, Madeira, and Iceland not once but three times in 2024. Her travels alone cost her a fortune, with flights setting her back \u20b95 lakh and trips like South Africa with her parents reaching \u20b98 lakh.\nHowever, the real kicker? She also splurged \u20b922 lakh on a new Hyundai car and spent \u20b95 lakh on medical expenses her insurance didn\u2019t cover. Surprisingly, she admitted she didn\u2019t even include costs for food, shopping, or daily expenses in her calculations.\nIn the reel, Sharanya explained that this massive shift in her spending philosophy came after years of being an \u201cobsessive saver.\u201d She credited her dad and friends for pushing her to loosen her purse strings and embrace a more joyful approach to life, calling it a \u201csignificant move\u201d that helped her get through a difficult year. While her admission of spending \u20b950 lakh on travel and lifestyle changes was meant to inspire, it left the internet divided.\nA post shared by Instagram (@instagram)\nHer post quickly went viral, amassing over 1.3 million views and countless reactions. Some were curious about her finances, asking questions like, \u201cWhat\u2019s your source of income?\u201d Others couldn\u2019t wrap their heads around her budget, particularly how she managed three trips to Iceland for just \u20b92.5 lakh. Sharanya responded to one such comment, explaining that parts of her Iceland trips were sponsored, and she excluded flight costs.\nBut not all reactions were positive. Many questioned the sustainability of such extravagant spending, with one user humorously pointing out, \u201cFinance influencers are experiencing trauma after this reel.\u201d Still, some applauded her bold approach, agreeing that sometimes, it\u2019s okay to prioritize experiences over savings.\nSharanya\u2019s reel also touched on her decision to focus on cutting down material spending in 2025, a move that seems ironic considering her lavish 2024. But hey, if anyone\u2019s living the dream of turning wanderlust into a lifestyle, it\u2019s her.\nSo, would you blow \u20b950 lakh in a year to chase your adventures, or are you more team save every penny? Either way, Sharanya\u2019s reel has left us all questioning how far we\u2019d go for a year of unforgettable memories."

        "They Might Always Be On Your Screens Now, But These 9 Celebrities Have Ditched Smartphones",
        "Gone are the days when people needed their morning newspaper when the dawn broke. Nowadays, people need their morning dose of Instagram right after waking, even with squinted eyes. In this era of social media where likes and shares have become the currency of validation, you must be hardly seeing anyone around without a smartphone.\nHowever, there are some celebrities, who are not the biggest fan of smartphones. Forget smartphones, some of them are averse to using cell phones of any kind altogether. Despite being in show business, from cinema to sports, and often appearing on our phone screens, they have chosen a rather tech-free life. Professional disturbances, personal distraction \u2013 the reasons are many, but here\u2019s a list of some of them who have escaped our favourite little black mirrors.\nIn a world where an actor\u2019s stardom decides the box office of a movie, few directors pull crowds to the theaters. And Nolan\u2019s name arguably would top that list. However, I was shocked to learn that the influential director doesn\u2019t use a smartphone. Not only that, he doesn\u2019t have an email ID and refrains from using the internet. He has also banned the use of phones on his sets, for the cast and crew.\nThe Shape of You singer revealed that he decided not to keep a phone in 2015 because he was losing real-life interaction. his team gives him a phone when needed. He explained that the constant back-and-forth of messaging and the pressure of responding on time led him to adopt a phone-free lifestyle.\nThe singing sensation once revealed that he doesn\u2019t have a mobile phone, instead, he uses an\u00a0iPad\u00a0for communication. Bieber said he does this to limit the means of communication, \u201cI definitely learned how to have boundaries, and I just don\u2019t feel like I owe anybody anything,\u201d\nThe veteran actor of Dune and Pulp Fiction said that he continues to embrace a tech-free lifestyle. He doesn\u2019t use a cell phone and watches movies and shows on physical DVDs. He says he has never used emails or Twitter.\nThe Kahaani and Jagga Jasoos actor said in an interview that he once bought a smartphone and had WhatsApp and Instagram accounts made. However, he rarely used to check them because he felt they were distracting him from life and work. Now if he goes to a remote area, he carries a simple phone.\nThe CEO of Berkshire Hathaway and a minor owner of Apple shares was a long-term user of a $20 (1,438 approximately) Samsung SCH-U320 flip phone. He finally decided to ditch his old and upgraded to an iPhone 11 in 2020 at the age of 89.\nWell, we had to mention MS on this list because of all the anecdotes we hear from his team-mates. They say it\u2019s practically impossible to contact him via a phone when MS is away. The former Indian captain had said in an event in 2023, \u201cI do have a phone but I use it only to set an alarm at night. It does the job of waking me up in the morning.\u201d He was recently seen using a smartphone in a practice session, but many fans pointed out that he was just swiping notifications.\nRare video of MS Dhoni using Mobile that too in the net session \ud83d\ude01\u2764\ufe0f#MSDhoni #IPl2025 pic.twitter.com/0IgzQi2QZz\nMusic legend Sir Elton John has been vocal about his disdain for cell phones over the years. He does not even own a mobile phone and says that his husband David Furnish runs his Instagram. He credits his social media presence to his team. \u201cI don\u2019t have a phone. The office staff runs Twitter for me. I don\u2019t do it myself,\u201d Elton once said.\nThe star of Divergent and The Fault in Our Stars revealed way back that she was not a big technology fan. In fact, she revealed that she didn\u2019t even have a cellphone. Shailene said that if she were to have a phone, it would have been a flip one. According to her, there\u2019s a lack of privacy, camaraderie, and community than there\u2019s ever been, which is one of the reasons for her decision.\nWell, to most of us dropping off our smartphones sounds like a nightmare. However, if we took some time off doom-scrolling, the world may appear a little less doomed.\n"

But do you know the story behind the remarkable success of the e-commerce platform?\nWell, let us tell you that it was founded by two IITians - Vidit Aatrey and Sanjeev Barnwal. Let's delve into their journey.\nJourney of Meesho founders\nVidit Aatrey and Sanjeev Barnwal were classmates at IIT, Delhi. After graduating from IIT, Barnwal moved to Japan where he joined Sony's Core Tech team. Despite having a high-paying job, he still had an aspiration to start something of his own.\nLater, he connected to his friend, Vidit Aatrey, who was then working at\u00a0Bangalore-based InMobi firm. The duo left their respective jobs in 2015. While they were contemplating a startup idea, they envisioned a marketplace with the goal to develop a platform that could prioritise a business's success.\nIn late 2015, Meesho began operations at a small two-bedroom flat in Karnataka. Interestingly, their first workstation was a dining table in the apartment.\nBirth of Meesho\nVidit Aatrey and Sanjeev Barnwal came up with a simple idea - to enable anyone to start their own business online. Their experience at IIT Delhi and in the corporate world helped them discover that while giant e-commerce platforms were flourishing, there still was a need for an accessible platform where small businesses and individuals could sell their products.\nAnd rest is history! Meesho was then founded with the approach to provide an accessible platform, connecting suppliers\u00a0manufacturers, and end consumers via social media channels such as Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and more.\nRise of Meesho\nMeesho stands for - Meri Shop (Apni Dukaan). In April 2021, its valuation reached 2.1 billion dollars. Moreover, by September 2021, it reached nearly 4.9 billion dollars, signalling that its success was merely the beginning.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "BOLLYWOOD\nKiran shared that the makers in South cinema are ready to take chances as it's a small industry, and they know their audience very well.\nVarsha Agarwal\nUpdated : Mar 08, 2025, 09:25 PM IST\nFilmmaker Kiran Rao candidly discussed the Bollywood vs South Cinema debate and said that she finds a \"sense of conviction\" when it comes to telling stories in South films.\nIn a conversation with ANI, she said, \"I watch a lot of Malayalam films, and what I'm always struck by is how they really seem very bold in their story choices. 'Uleri', which was released last year, is such a bold story idea. Even their horror films, like I saw a film called 'Bramayugam,' which is a Mammootty film, incredibly artistically made using folk tales and the folklore of Kerala, and it's a very different idea. There is a sort of a sense of conviction about telling stories that are different. And I think that's what stands them in great stead.\"\nKiran, however, shared that the makers in South cinema are ready to take chances as it's a small industry, and they know their audience very well. \"It's the chances that they are taking with the stories they are telling, and perhaps that also comes from the fact that they are usually smaller industries that are technically only catering to their own, culturally, their language and their community. And so they are quite unafraid to try different things. They know their audience, and their producers are willing to take chances on new storytelling,\" she added.\nShe said what is incredible is that \"the audience is going to watch films,\" and the makers are \"very much in touch with their audience. They understand their audience very well.\" However, she shared that Bollywood is big, and while making the movie, filmmakers keep in mind that they have to cater for a \"wider audience\". \"You are making films for a diaspora, you are making films for all the states of the country. And I think maybe that is why people want to make something that they are very sure will succeed, and maybe that's why there's a tendency to go to a film that's already successful, like a remake,\" she said. She insisted that it is important to have \"producers who are willing to take a chance\" if you are willing to have a different cinema.\nRao started her career as the assistant director in the epic film 'Lagaan', directed by Ashutosh Gowariker, whom she also assisted later on 'Swades: We, the People'. Lagaan was nominated for the 74th Academy Award in the foreign language film category. Aamir Khan produced and starred in the same film. Before 'Lagaan', she also played a minute role as a supporting actress in 'Dil Chahta Hai'. She has directed the films 'Dhobi Ghat' (2011) and 'Laapataa Ladies' (2024).\n\r\n\t(This story has not been edited by DNA staff and is published from ANI)\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

Gujarat, India's western hub, is renowned for nurturing successful entrepreneurs, thanks to its rich cultural heritage that instills strong work ethics, business values, and a commerce-friendly mindset from a young age.\nAbhijit Choksi, founder of Stockifi and a Gujarati, explained through an analysis on the Gujarati dominance in business and finance. Taking to X, Choksi gave figures that show the influence of Gujarati community in India\u2019s economy. He wrote, \u201c108 out of India\u2019s 191 billionaires are Gujarati.\u201d His post on Gujarati community dominating the business market went viral. While posting this, he also brought to light a very frequent question that makes people curious about their dominance in India\u2019s business sector. \u201cGujarat, which has 5% of India\u2019s population, contributes over 8% to the GDP and 18% of the industrial output,\u201d he wrote.\n108 out of 191 Indian billionaires are Gujarati.\n\r\n\t\tA Gujarati living in America makes three times more than an average American.\n\r\n\t\tGujarat, which has 5% of India\u2019s population, contributes over 8% to the GDP and 18% of the industrial output.\n\r\n\t\tGujarat has a land area of only 6% but\u2026 pic.twitter.com/ZId5idzCNS\nCiting facts, Abhijit Choksi highlighted that \u201ca Gujarati living in America makes three times more than an average American.\u201d\u00a0 What is more astounding is that \u201cGujarat has a land area of only 6% but accounts for 25% of India\u2019s total exports,\u201d mentioned Abhijit Choksi. Gujaratis dominate various industries, but some of them where they are mostly seen include diamond trading and stock markets. In the U.S., they own over 60% of motels, showcasing their global economic impact.\nSo, now the question is, \u201cWhy is the Gujarati community so insanely successful in business and finance?\u201d Chokshi suggests it is because of two reasons: Generational wisdom and an entrepreneurial mindset, along with an unparalleled quality to adapt, learn the art and nuisances of markets, and thereby take new markets. He lists out 20 reasons why Gujaratis are not participants in the Indian economy or elsewhere too but also define them.\nChokshi also points out to a fact that is one of the main attributes of the Gujarati success. He said that Gujaratis prefer business over jobs and that is the case throughout generations. \u201cNaukri toh gareebon ka dhanda che\u201d (Jobs are for the poor) is a common belief in Gujarati families. In Gujarati households, children are raised with guidance on businesses and their families managing cash flow, cracking deals, assessing risks and business being a way of life rather than just a means of earning around them makes them curious towards this and fill their mentality with business aspects since the start.\nAnother trait he highlighted is that of risk-taking, this is according to Choksi, one of the defining traits. From such business opportunities like diamond trading to even risky areas like stock markets, Gujaratis naturally adapt to uncertainties and take opportunities. They can do this as since their education days they were fed with financial education. Children of businessmen help their family members from a young age and throughout learn real-world economics that are not even taught in big MBA schools.\nGujaratis' success is fueled by a strong support network, where they provide each other with financial assistance, guidance, and business opportunities. Their thrifty lifestyle also contributes to their prosperity, as they prioritize reinvesting profits over lavish spending, resulting in sustained wealth growth.\nChokshi also tells how Gujaratis dominate diamond market. \u201cSurat alone processes 90% of the world\u2019s diamonds,\u201d he highlighted, and explaining how Gujarati entrepreneurs outrun their competitors in Belgium and Israel. He also noted that more than 60% of India\u2019s stock market traders are Gujarati or Marwari, shaping financial markets for centuries.\nSome of the top Gujarati businessmen who are India\u2019s richest and even among richest businessmen in the world are:\nGautam Adani of Ahmedabad-based multinational conglomerate, Adani Group. He has a net worth of Rs 140,200 crore.\nMukesh Ambani of Reliance Industries with a net worth of Rs 8,134 lakh crore\nNirma brand\u2019s founder Karsanbhai Patel who has a net worth of Rs 31,500 crore\nAjim Premji of Wipro who has a net worth of Rs 96,500.40 crores\nUday Kotak of the Kotak Mahindra Group has a net worth of Rs 1,11,474 crore.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

The high-speed rail will run on a 260-kilometer elevated track, passing through five key districts, including Patna. The National High-Speed Rail Corporation Limited (NHSRCL) is working on the project, with the Detailed Project Report (DPR) expected to be completed by August, according to reports.\nThis bullet train will be a part of the Varanasi-Patna-Howrah High-Speed Rail Corridor, covering a total distance of 800 kilometers. In Bihar, the train will pass through Patna, Buxar, Ara, Jehanabad, and Gaya.\nThe project will be completed in two phases. The first phase will connect Varanasi to Howrah via important stations like Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya Junction, Ara, Buxar, Patna, and Gaya. The second phase will extend the route from Delhi to Varanasi, linking Delhi to Howrah through a high-speed network.\nThe bullet train in Bihar will run at a top speed of 350 km/h, drastically cutting travel time. It will be based on Japanese technology and will feature modern amenities such as automatic doors, CCTV cameras for security, and mobile charging points for passenger convenience.\nIn Patna alone, the project will require around 135 hectares of land across 58 villages. Authorities have started the land acquisition process, offering four times the market value for rural land and twice the market value for urban properties, according to reports.\nThe NHSRCL is set to appoint an agency to finalise the DPR, which will outline costs, timelines, and technical details. This project is expected to boost Bihar\u2019s economy, create jobs, and improve connectivity across major cities.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

Sholay held the title of the highest-grossing Indian film since its release.\nRiddhima Kanetkar\nUpdated : Mar 08, 2025, 04:47 PM IST | Edited by : Riddhima Kanetkar\nIn the past few years, South films have dominated the box office, leaving many Bollywood films behind in its wake. While Bollywood has managed to catch up with its recent releases like Jawan, Pathaan, Stree 2, and Gadar 2, the discussion of South vs Bollywood is at an all-time high. However, today we will tell you about a time when Bollywood films became such big hits that their tickets were sold in lakhs. There was one such Bollywood film, whose budget and earnings are difficult to surpass even today. This is not a South film, but a Bollywood Hindi film whose records are unbroken to date. This film is also the most-watched film to date.\nToday, we will tell you about one such film that made such a record in its name, which no film has been able to break to date. Many stars were seen together in this film and compared to now, it was made on the lowest budget, which broke records of earnings.\nWe are talking about Ramesh Sippy's superhit film Sholay, which was released in 1975, starring Amitabh Bachchan, Jaya Bachchan, Dharmendra, Hema Malini, and Sanjeev Kumar in lead roles. Sholay held the title of the highest-grossing Indian film since its release and held it for almost a decade.\nAs per IMDb, Sholay has been re-released many times over the years and has continually attracted 15-18 crore viewers in Indian theatres. The film also did great business worldwide, especially in Soviet Russia where 4.8 crore tickets were sold initially and 6 crore tickets in total. Interestingly, Sholay was made on a budget of just Rs 3 crore in that era.\nReports state that 25 crore tickets of Sholay were sold out instantly after its release. The ticket price, at the time, was only Rs 2. Sholay, released in 1975, did a business of Rs 35 crore worldwide. According to today's inflation, this figure is equivalent to about Rs 2800 crore, which is much more than any Indian film except Mughal-e-Azam.\nRecently, in August 2024, this blockbuster and cult classic film written by Salim Javed was re-released at Regal Cinema in Mumbai. Only one show of the film was kept in the theater, which was at 5:30 pm.\nREAD |\u00a0Javed Akhtar feared Lagaan would fail because of Amitabh Bachchan, Aamir Khan REVEALS why\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

According to rumours, Akash secretly harboured feelings for Shloka but took his time to express them. After finishing their 12th-grade exams, Akash finally mustered the courage to confess his love. Fortunately for him, Shloka said yes\u2014and the rest, as they say, is history.\nAfter that, the two continued their education by studying overseas.\u00a0 Despite living in different places, it's incredible how the two remained in contact and deeply in love. They actively participated in their father's business after they got back to India.\nUp until March 2018, when a photo of the two of them together with Shloka kissing Akash on the cheek became viral, the couple kept a low profile. The photo, which was taken at a gathering in Goa, generated a lot of attention on social media and led to rumours that the couple will soon get married.\nThe couple's engagement at a five-star resort in Goa in March 2018 put an end to rumours. On March 9, 2019, Akash and Shloka tied the knot in a grand wedding ceremony.

In a heartfelt message, he shared how his granddaughters have strengthened his resolve to build a world where women face no barriers in achieving their dreams. Gautam Adani spoke about the strong women who shaped his journey, including his mother, wife Priti Adani, and others that he met through his work.\nHe recalled how his mother managed their large family with resilience and how his wife's dedication to the Adani Foundation has transformed lives across rural India.\nIn a social media post he said, \"A decade ago, as I cradled my first granddaughter's delicate fingers, I made a silent vow: to help build a world where her aspirations would know no bounds, where her voice would resonate with the same respect as any man's, and where her worth would be measured solely by her character and contributions\".\nHe further added, \"Now, blessed with three beautiful granddaughters, this promise burns brighter and more urgent than ever. International Women's Day is not merely a date on the calendar; it's a poignant reminder of the strides we've made and the journey that still lies ahead. For me, this mission is deeply personal across many dimensions - as a young boy being inspired by his mother, as a business leader witnessing the challenges faced by women in leadership, as a husband inspired by my wife Priti's unwavering dedication to the Adani Foundation, and as a grandfather dreaming of a world without limits for the girls who affectionately call me \"Dadu.\"\nHe also highlighted key initiatives by the Adani Foundation, such as the Butterfly Effect framework, which supports women throughout different stages of life, and the Lakhpati Didis program, which has helped over 1,000 women achieve financial independence.\nHe said \"Moreover, our 'Lakhpati Didis' initiative celebrates over 1,000 women who have achieved financial independence through enhanced entrepreneurial skills\". Gautam Adani shared a personal experience of visiting one of his company's ports, where he noticed the lack of women in leadership roles. This led him to push for change, ensuring policies were more inclusive and providing mentorship opportunities for women.\nHe added, \"Several years ago, during a visit to one of our port projects, I noticed the absence of women in operational and leadership roles. It was not due to a lack of capability but rather the absence of pathways for them into these traditionally male-dominated fields. This realization sparked a personal commitment to change\".\nDespite progress, he acknowledged that many women still face challenges in leadership roles. He expressed hope that his granddaughters would one day enter boardrooms where they are valued as equals.\nGautam Adani said, \"Yet, beneath that pride is a quiet impatience. Because despite how far we have come, my granddaughters may still enter boardrooms where they are the only women at the table. They may still have to fight harder, speak louder, and prove themselves twice over to receive the recognition they deserve. They may still face doors that open too slowly, or not at all\".\nFor his granddaughters he added \"And to my granddaughters, who may one day read this: My dearest girls, The world you inherit should be one where your brilliance is met with open doors, not glass ceilings. Where your ambitions are never questioned, only encouraged. Where your voice is not just heard, but sought after. I vow to keep pushing, to keep breaking barriers, until that world is not just a vision but a reality. Because you, and every girl like you, deserve to walk into every room knowing you belong. Your Dadu.\"\nConcluding his message, he urged men in leadership positions to see gender equality as a shared responsibility, stating, \"The talents, insights, and leadership of women are invaluable resources we cannot afford to squander.\n\"This year's International Women's Day theme, Accelerate Action, resonates deeply with vision of creating an inclusive future where every woman can thrive\".\nExcept for the headline, the story has not been edited by DNA staff and is published from ANI.\n\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "Amid tariff war, Donald Trump hints at revisiting US-Canada border demarcation treaty",
        "WORLD\nThe report, which cited four people with firsthand knowledge of their content, on the condition of anonymity, also noted that Trump, in an early February call, challenged the border treaty between the two countries and told Trudeau he didn't like their shared water agreements.\nSagar Malik\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 08:58 AM IST\nAmid the ongoing tariff war between the two countries, US President Donald Trump, during his conversation with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, raised the point that he did not believe in the border demarcation treaty between them and wants to revise the boundary, the New York Times reported.\nThe report, which cited four people with firsthand knowledge of their content, on the condition of anonymity, also noted that Trump, in an early February call, challenged the border treaty between the two countries and told Trudeau he didn't like their shared water agreements.\nRecently, Justin Trudeau made an extraordinary statement that was largely lost in the fray of the moment, as per NYT.\r\n\t\"The excuse that he's giving for these tariffs today of fentanyl is completely bogus, completely unjustified, completely false,\" Trudeau told the news media in Ottawa.\n\"What he wants is to see a total collapse of the Canadian economy, because that'll make it easier to annex us,\" he added.\r\n\tThe conversation between Washington and Ottawa on February 3 not only included discussions on staving off tariffs on Canadian exports but Trump also laid out a long list of grievances he had with the trade relationship between the two countries, including Canada's protected dairy sector, the difficulty American banks face in doing business in Canada and Canadian consumption taxes that Trump deems unfair because they make American goods more expensive.\nNotably, the border treaty that Trump referred to was established in 1908 and finalized the international boundary between Canada, then a British dominion, and the United States, as reported by NYT.\nTrump also mentioned revisiting the sharing of lakes and rivers between the two nations, which is regulated by a number of treaties, a topic he's expressed interest in in the past.\nThe report further cited Trump's response to the media on January 7, wherein, he had said that he is planning to use \"economic force\" against Canada.\nThe persistent social media references to Canada as the \"51st state\" and Trudeau as its \"Governor\" had begun to grate both inside the Canadian government and more broadly, as reported by NYT.\nFollowing the talks between the two leaders, Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick in a conversation with Canada's finance minister, Dominic LeBlanc, issued a devastating message, according to several people familiar with the call that Trump, he said, had come to realize that the relationship between the United States and Canada was governed by a slew of agreements and treaties that were 'easy to abandon.'\nHe also wanted to eject Canada out of an intelligence-sharing group known as the 'Five Eyes' that also includes Britain, Australia and New Zealand, according to NYT.\nHe wanted to tear up the Great Lakes agreements and conventions between the two nations that lay out how they share and manage Lakes Superior, Huron, Erie and Ontario, the report further added.\nIt also noted that he is also reviewing military cooperation between the two countries, particularly the North American Aerospace Defence Command.\nA sigh of relief, however, has been that the Secretary of State Marco Rubio, has refrained from delivering threats, and recently dismissed the idea that the United States was looking at scrapping military cooperation.\nHowever, Canada's politicians across the spectrum, and Canadian society at large, are frayed and deeply concerned. Officials do not see the Trump administration's threats as empty; they see a new normal when it comes to the United States, the report added.\n\r\n\t(This story has not been edited by DNA staff and is published from ANI).\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "Months after Ratan Tata's death, Tata Sons Chairman N Chandrasekaran shares heartfelt memory: 'In last few years...'",
        "BUSINESS\nRatan Tata, who passed away last year at the age of 86, led the Tata Group for over two decades\nShivam Verma\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 01:08 PM IST\nTata Sons' chairman N Chandrasekaran recently shared a heartfelt memory of Ratan Tata at an event. According to The Economic Times, he recalled how, despite his declining health in recent years, Tata always made it a point to personally receive him and see him off. \"I told him, \u2018Sir, you don\u2019t have to do this,\u2019 but he insisted. Courtesy and fairness were deeply important to him,\" Chandrasekaran said.\nRatan Tata, who passed away last year at the age of 86, led the Tata Group for over two decades, spearheading its global expansion. Under his leadership, the company acquired Tetley Tea (2000), Corus Steel (2007), and Jaguar-Land Rover (2008), marking India\u2019s entry into major international markets. He was also the driving force behind the Indica, India\u2019s first homegrown car, and the affordable Nano car project.\nA graduate in architecture from Cornell University, Tata joined the family business in 1962 and took over as chairman in 1991. He introduced key reforms, promoting younger leaders and modernizing the group's operations.\nRatan Tata was known for his modest lifestyle and commitment to philanthropy, with two-thirds of Tata Sons\u2019 shares held by charitable trusts. After stepping down, he became an active startup investor, backing companies like Paytm, Ola Electric, and Urban Company.\nIn recognition of his immense contributions, he was awarded the Padma Vibhushan, India\u2019s second-highest civilian honor, in 2008.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "Not Amitabh Bachchan, Kamal Haasan, Aamir Khan, Shah Rukh Khan, Rajinikanth, Mohanlal; this Indian actor has his most films sent to Oscars",
        "BOLLYWOOD\nRaghubir Yadav-starred eight films, the most by any Indian actor, have been sent to Oscars in the Best International Feature Film/Best Foreign Language Film category.\nAman Wadhwa\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 12:48 PM IST | Edited by : Aman Wadhwa\nThe Academy Awards, commonly known as the Oscars, are one of the most prestigious honors in global cinema. They not only recognise excellence in Hollywood but also celebrate the finest films from around the world through the category of Best International Feature Film, which was previously called Best Foreign Language Film until 2020.\nHaving their film selected for the Oscars is a significant achievement in an actor's career. Several Indian actors, including Kamal Haasan and Aamir Khan, have had multiple films chosen as official entries to the Academy Awards. However, one actor has appeared in a total of eight films that have been submitted to the Oscars, the highest number by any Indian actor to date.\nThe record is held by Raghubir Yadav, whose films sent to the Oscars include Salaam Bombay!, Rudaali, Bandit Queen, 1947 Earth, Lagaan, Water, Peepli Live, and Newton (in chronological order). Among these, Salaam Bombay!, Lagaan, and Water even got shortlisted among the final five nominees in the Best Foreign Film category but failed to win the award. Additionally, Water was submitted as Canada\u2019s official entry to the Oscars, while the other seven were sent from India.\nKamal Haasan is second on this list, with seven of his films being submitted as India\u2019s official entries to the Academy Awards.

        "Trump, Musk, NASA, and SpaceX: The fight over Sunita Williams\u2019 return",
        "WORLD\nPresident Donald Trump said he had personally asked Elon Musk for help in bringing astronauts back from the International Space Station. He also used the moment to criticize President Biden and his administration.\nGirish Linganna\nUpdated : Mar 08, 2025, 06:29 PM IST\nPresident Donald Trump said he had personally asked Elon Musk for help in bringing astronauts back from the International Space Station. He also used the moment to criticize President Biden and his administration.\nThe SpaceX Dragon spacecraft, which will bring astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore back to Earth, has been at the space station since September and was always supposed to bring them back home. Even so, Trump mentioned in the Oval Office on Thursday, March 6, that he had given Elon permission a week earlier to bring them back.\nTrump also said that former President Joe Biden felt embarrassed about the situation and decided to leave them there.\nThe astronauts earlier told CNN's Anderson Cooper that they don\u2019t feel \"stuck\" at the space station. However, NASA and the astronauts have struggled to completely dismiss this idea, partly because of the political back-and-forth involving Trump and Musk.\nWilmore reassured Cooper on February 13 that they don\u2019t feel abandoned, stuck, or stranded. He was responding to a question about Trump\u2019s remarks, as reported by USA Today.\nWhat\u2019s the latest with the Starliner?\nAstronauts Wilmore and Williams were chosen for the first crewed flight of the Starliner. In June 2024, they launched on a mission to test the Boeing Starliner, which is designed to eventually carry NASA astronauts to space alongside SpaceX\u2019s Dragon.\nBoth astronauts are highly experienced and are making their third trip to the space station.\nNASA found technical problems with the spacecraft, which delayed the astronauts' return home. In the end, the space agency had to bring the Starliner back to Earth in early September without its crew.\nThe SpaceX Dragon spacecraft, which will now bring astronauts Williams and Wilmore back to Earth, has been at the space station since late September. It originally arrived with the Crew-9 mission.\nAs part of NASA's plan, the spacecraft carried only two astronauts instead of the usual four. This left extra seats available for Williams and Wilmore on the trip back to Earth.\nThe Boeing\u00a0 Starliner crew members, Sunita Williams and Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore, joined the Crew-9 mission, whose astronauts are still completing their full stay in space.\nNASA announced in a mission update that the Dragon capsule, carrying the four astronauts of Crew-10, is set to launch as early as March 12. It will travel on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Kennedy Space Center in Florida, replacing the Crew-9 team.\nAs the name implies, this is the 10th crew rotation mission to the space station under NASA's commercial crew program.\nAstronaut Hague said in a news conference from space on Tuesday, March 4, that Crew-9 will pass the mission to Crew-10 before returning to Earth after a successful long stay.\nWhen the new astronauts reach the space station, there will be a few days of handover activities. After that, Williams and Wilmore will join Crew-9 in the SpaceX Dragon to leave the station, possibly around March 25.\nNASA astronaut Nick Hague will lead the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft as it returns to Earth, along with Mission Specialists Suni Williams, Butch Wilmore, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov. The crew practiced on Tuesday, 4th March using Dragon's computer tablets and reviewed the steps needed for the spacecraft to move away from the space station and reenter Earth's atmosphere before landing in the ocean near Florida. Hague and Gorbunov have been on the station since September 29, 2024, while Williams and Wilmore arrived on June 6.\n\n(The author Girish Linganna of this article is an award-winning Science Writer and a Defence, Aerospace & Political Analyst based in Bengaluru.

        "VIRAL\nThe house that was indeed burnt was of former cricket captain Mashrafe Mortaza who is a member of Parliament of the Awami League party.\nHarshvardhan Jaiman\nUpdated : Aug 08, 2024, 01:43 PM IST\nAmid escalating protests in Bangladesh, misinformation has spread regarding the alleged burning of cricketer Liton Das\u2019 home. A viral social media posts claimed that Das' house was set ablaze by protesters, following unrest in the country linked to political tensions.\r\n\t\u00a0\r\n\tHowever, these claims have been debunked. The house that was indeed burnt was of former cricket captain Mashrafe Mortaza who is a member of Parliament of the Awami League party. Several social media users have clarified the claim and urged people not to spread false rumours that can hamper the image of nation in front of the world.\u00a0\r\n\t\u00a0\r\n\tNot only Mortaza\u2019s home, but the residences of other Awami League members have also been demonstrated by the aggressiveness of the people. After the political discontent, particularly following the resignation of PM Sheikh Hasina's appointment, the riots escalated.\u00a0\r\n\t\u00a0\r\n\tFurther, there was a video clip of former captain Shakib Al Hasan, which initially appeared to support the current protestation. This video was, however, unrelated to the current affairs, but it went on to depict, how the population was misinformed during such unstable times.\n\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

The Jaipur consumer forum has issued notices to the three actors, along with the chairman of JB Industries, the manufacturer of Vimal Gutkha, to appear on March 19.\nThe Jaipur-II District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum has summoned the actors and the chairman of JB Industries to respond to the allegations. The complaint also accused the company of promoting a harmful product, gutkha, which is a mix of pan masala and tobacco, under the false impression that it contains saffron.\nThe notices were issued by Commission Chairman Gyarsilal Meena and member Hemlata Agarwal, following a complaint filed by consumer rights activist Yogendra Singh Badiyal. The complaint alleged that JB Industries falsely claimed that every grain of Vimal Pan Masala contains saffron, which is highly unlikely given the significant price difference between saffron and the pan masala product. Saffron costs around Rs 4 lakh per kilogram, while the pan masala pouch is sold for just Rs 5.\nThe petitioner argued that this misleading advertisement is intended to deceive consumers into buying the product, which poses serious health risks due to the presence of tobacco.\nMeanwhile, the actors have not yet issued any statement in connection to the legal trouble.\u00a0Earlier, the actors have long faced criticism for endorsing pan masalas, with Ajay, Shah Rukh Khan, and Akshay Kumar being among those who have faced severe backlash for their involvement in pan masala advertisements. Akshay Kumar, in particular, had faced intense scrutiny for featuring in a pan masala ad, prompting him to issue an unconditional apology for hurting his fans' sentiments. He also vowed to never endorse such products again, acknowledging the harmful impact of pan masalas on public health.\nMeanwhile, on the work front, Shah Rukh will next be seen in Siddharth Anand\u2019s King, Ajay Devgn will feature in Raid 2.

Adding to the mystery, the cast members had not tagged her in their posts, amidst her ongoing legal issues.\nVarsha Agarwal\nUpdated : Mar 08, 2025, 05:25 PM IST\nThe recently-released Nadaaniyan features Ibrahim Ali Khan and Khushi Kapoor in lead roles, alongside an ensemble cast including Mahima Chaudhary, Suniel Shetty, Dia Mirza, and Jugal Hansraj. The film also includes influencer Apoorva Makhija, who is currently embroiled in a controversy surrounding India's Got Latent show. Interestingly, the cast members have not tagged Apoorva in their social media posts, sparking speculation about whether this was a deliberate snub or a decision made by her team.\nWas Apoorva Makhija deliberately snubbed from Nadaaniyan?\nApoorva's absence from the film's premiere and her silence on social media about her role in the movie had sparked curiosity. Adding to the mystery, the cast members had not tagged her in their posts, amidst her ongoing legal issues. Her co-star Agasthya Shah shared behind-the-scenes photos from the film's set on Instagram, tagging Ibrahim Ali Khan, Khushi Kapoor, and others. Notably, one of the images featured Apoorva, but she was conspicuously left out of the tags. Even other cast members including Neel, Aaliyah, and Dev, shared a group photo from the film's set, but none of them tagged Apoorva.\nFans spotted her in the image and began questioning why she wasn't tagged.Comments flooded in, with some expressing delight at seeing her, such as \"Finally saw Apoorva after a long time\". Others wondered why she wasn't tagged, with comments like \"Oh, she didn\u2019t tag the Rebel kid\", \"Why isn\u2019t Apoorva tagged?\", \"Rebel absence is just not so done\", and \"Why is no one tagging Rebel Kid?\". However, the mystery was solved when a fan revealed that Apoorva had turned off Instagram's tagging feature, preventing anyone from tagging her in posts. This move is likely an attempt to avoid unwanted negativity and harassment on social media amid her ongoing controversy.\n\nApoorva Makhija's controversy\nApoorva is currently embroiled in controversy surrounding Ranveer Allahbadia's comments on Samay Raina's show, India's Got Latent. The National Commission for Women (NCW) has summoned Apoorva, Ranveer, Samay Raina, Ashish Chanchlani, and others in connection with the issue. The controversy began when Allahbadia made offensive remarks about parental sex on the show, sparking widespread outrage and multiple complaints against him.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

The president made his case for his reciprocal tariffs, which will commence April 2. He wants to impose the same tariff on imports from foreign countries as those nations impose on US exports. \"Other countries have used tariffs against us for decades and now it's our turn to start using them against those other countries. On average, the European Union, China, Brazil, India, - Mexico and Canada - Have you heard of them -and countless other nations charge us tremendously higher tariffs than we charge them.

It never was,\u201d he said.\n\r\n\tTrump added that from April 2, reciprocal tariffs will kick in, and whatever \u201cthey tariff us, other countries, we will tariff them. That's reciprocal back and forth. Whatever they tax us, we will tax them.

Meanwhile, reciprocal tariffs, expected to bring a significant shift in the US trade policies, is set to come in effect from April 2.\nThe US President also slammed countries like Canada for imposing 250 per cent tariffs on American dairy products, calling it \"unfair\".\n\"Canada has been ripping us off for years on tariffs for lumber and for dairy products. Two hundred and fifty percent. Nobody ever talks about that. Two hundred and fifty percent tariff, which is taking advantage of our farmers. So that's not going to happen anymore. We're going to be -- they'll be met with the exact same tariff unless they drop it,\" Trump said.\nNotably, the introduction of reciprocal tariffs is expected to have massive implications on the global trade relations, given other countries will have to reconsider their tariff policies.\nWith inputs from ANI.\n\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

They tied the knot on this day in 1985. Over the years, they have become some of the most influential figures in India.\nAs they celebrate 40 years together, it\u2019s worth noting that Nita Ambani is not only the wife of businessman Mukesh Ambani but also the chairperson and founder of the Reliance Foundation. Her personality and philanthropic work even impressed Mukesh\u2019s father, who chose her as the perfect match for his son.\nOn the occasion of Nita Ambani\u2019s 60th birthday, let\u2019s look back at how their love story began and how the two eventually got married.\nIt sounds like something from a fairy tale when Mukesh and Nita Ambani first meet. The renowned Reliance founder Dhirubhai Ambani first saw Nita when she was performing Bharatnatyam at a cultural event. He was struck by her grace and talent and thought she would be a perfect match for his son, Mukesh. He personally contacted Nita and suggested a meeting with Mukesh, taking everything into his own hands. This simple suggestion set the stage for what would later become an iconic love story.\nAs Mukesh and Nita spent more time together, their bond deepened. In a memorable moment that cemented their relationship, Mukesh made a spontaneous yet powerful proposal to Nita. One day when they were driving, Mukesh pulled to a stop at a light, turned to face Nita, and proposed marriage.\u00a0 Nita hesitated, taken aback by the sudden proposition.\u00a0 Then, in jest, Mukesh threatened to stop starting the car until she responded.\u00a0 This lighthearted yet sincere gesture won Nita\u2019s heart, and she said yes, beginning a partnership that has flourished over the years.\nMukesh and Nita have consistently supported one another as a relationship.\u00a0 Nita oversaw a number of important projects in the fields of sports, healthcare, and education when Mukesh assumed control of Reliance Industries. She was instrumental in the formation of the Mumbai Indians IPL cricket team and rose to become the chairman of the Dhirubhai Ambani International School. Through her work with the Reliance Foundation, Nita has promoted several charitable initiatives throughout India, demonstrating her dedication to the community.\nAs they celebrate their 40th wedding anniversary, Nita Ambani and Mukesh Ambani continue to inspire, showing how a deep connection and a shared commitment to family and community can create an enduring legacy.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

Among her many prized jewels, one gemstone holds a special place in her heart \u2014 the emerald. But for Nita Ambani, this dazzling green gem is more than just an accessory; it is believed to bring good luck, prosperity, and positivity.\nIn astrology, emerald, known as \u2018panna\u2019 in Hindi, is associated with financial stability, health benefits, and good fortune. Many believe that wearing an emerald can attract wealth and success, making it a powerful symbol of abundance. It is also linked to Goddess Lakshmi, the deity of prosperity, further enhancing its spiritual significance.\nEmeralds have been valued throughout history, particularly in Indian culture. Ancient rulers and Mughal emperors admired their rich green color and mystical properties. In Western traditions, emeralds are connected to Venus, the Roman goddess of love and beauty, symbolizing nature, fertility, and eternal youth.\nBeyond its cultural and spiritual significance, emeralds are also believed to have health benefits. Some say the gemstone can help reduce eye problems and bring emotional balance. It is also thought to drive away negativity, replacing it with peace and positivity.\nMany people admire Nita Ambani\u2019s success and see her love for emeralds as a reflection of her belief in their positive energy. For her, the emerald is not just a beautiful gemstone but a symbol of faith, prosperity, and well-being.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

After clinching a semi-final game against the World Champions Australia, Team India became the first team to reach the finals. On the other hand, the Kiwis defeated the South African side to make it to the finals. Both the teams faced each other in the tournament in the league stage and the game was won by Team India convincingly. Interestingly, India has reached the finals of the Champions Trophy for the third consecutive time, lifting the trophy in 2013 and losing the final match against Pakistan in 2017. So, stay tuned to this space for all the latest and live updates about the IND vs NZ game.\nAfter winning the crucial toss, New Zealand openers Will Young and Rachin Ravindra have provided a good start to their team.

After 1 over, NZ 4/0 with Young and Rachin out in the middle.\n\n\nNew Zealand (Playing XI) - Will Young, Rachin Ravindra, Kane Williamson, Daryl Mitchell, Tom Latham (WK), Glenn Phillips, Michael Bracewell, Mitchell Santner (C), Nathan Smith (In for Matt Henry), Kyle Jamieson, Will O Rourke.\nIndia (Unchanged Playing XI) - Rohit Sharma (C), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, Axar Patel, KL Rahul (WK), Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, Mohammad Shami, Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakaravarthy.\n\nBad luck for the Indian skipper in the toss continues as he lost his 12th straight one today. New Zealand skipper Mitchell Santner elected to bat first against the Men in Blue in the Final of ICC Champions Trophy 2025.\n\n\nIndia's star player Virat Kohli suffered a minor knee injury one day ahead of the Champions Trophy 2025 Final match. Fans are worried about Kohli's fitness for an important game like today's and this question will be answered when skipper Rohit Sharma arrives for the toss.\nOn the other hand, New Zealand's star pacer Matt Henry, who has taken important wickets in the tournament so far, suffered a shoulder injury while fielding in the semi-final match against South Africa.\n\nThe Indian skipper, who might be leading the team in winning matches in ICC events, has been facing tough luck in the toss. He has lost 11 consecutive toss in a row. So, will Rohit be able to put an end to this unique streak in today's game?\n\nA post shared by ICC (@icc)\nSeveral reports recently claimed that skipper Rohit Sharma might take retirement from the 50-over format just like he did after clinching the T20 World Cup. Speaking on the ongoing rumours, former skipper Sourav Ganguly said, ''Why is there talk of Rohit Sharma's retirement? Why is this even a question? He won the World Cup just a few months ago. I don't know what the selectors are thinking, Rohit is playing very well.''\n''India is far better than New Zealand. India played in the 2023 World Cup finals, won the 2024 T20 World Cup, and they are still unbeaten in this Champions Trophy. The same team will play,'' India Today reported quoting Sourav.\n\nTotal Matches Played - 119\nIndia - 61\nNew Zealand - 50\nTied - 1\nNo Result - 7\n\nThe Final of the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 between India and New Zealand can be viewed on Star Sports network and Jio Hotstar for live streaming on OTT.\nIndia and New Zealand have faced each other five times in the knockout stages of ICC tournaments wherein the Blackcaps have come out on top three times while the Men in Blue tasted success twice. Interestingly, India beat New Zealand in the 2000 edition of the Champions Trophy (then ICC KnockOut Trophy) in the quarterfinals but lost the game in the Final match by 4 wickets.\nBoth India and New Zealand have lifted the Champions Trophy in the past. While the Blackcaps clinched the inaugural tournament (then ICC KnockOut Trophy), Team India won the Champions Trophy in 2013 and shared the title with Sri Lanka in 2002.\nA post shared by ICC (@icc)\nTeam India's vice-captain Shubman Gill has given an update on whether skipper Rohit Sharma is retiring or not from the 50-over format after the completion of the ongoing ICC event. Speaking at the pre-match conference, Gill said, ''No discussion in the dressing room or with me, even Rohit bhai would be thinking about the Champions Trophy final lime all of us. So, nothing like that now.''\n''I think once the match ends tomorrow, he will make a decision. There is no talk about it within the setup,'' he added.\n\nThe New Zealand captain is confident of his team's ability ahead of the Champions Trophy Final. ''It's easy to say it's just another game, it's obviously not, but I think the way you approach it has to be the same. We've done a lot of good stuff this tournament, we're just trying to progress and build on the things we've been doing as a team.''\nThe New Zealand captain is confident of his team's ability ahead of the #ChampionsTrophy Final\n\r\n\t\tMore from Mitchell Santner https://t.co/1nUEF7mnrc pic.twitter.com/vgoTyITBFz\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

Shah Rukh Khan also made an appearance in this film.\nRiddhima Kanetkar\nUpdated : Mar 08, 2025, 10:27 AM IST | Edited by : Riddhima Kanetkar\nMany actors in the industry have gone through immense battles before making their place in the world of acting. It was only after facing the heat of struggle that their luck shone and they became successful. One such actor is Nana Patekar, who made his acting debut in Bollywood with the 1978 drama Gaman and laboured both professionally and personally to be as successful as he is today. Based on his hard work and dedication, Nana Patekar not only made his place in Bollywood but also received a lot of respect from his fans and peers. Nana Patekar has also been awarded the National Award thrice and was also given the Padma Shri award for his dedication to the field of Films and Arts in 2013.\nHowever, all these achievements did not come overnight. Many people are unaware that there was a time when Nana Patekar used to work for just Rs 35. During his years of struggle, Nana Patekar took up a job painting movie posters in Chunabhatti, walking 8 kilometers daily for a modest monthly wage of Rs 35.\nNot only was Nana Patekar's young adulthood, but his childhood was also spent in extreme poverty, thanks to a trusted acquaintance who deceitfully took over the family business.\nIn an interview with Siddharth Kannan, Nana Patekar said that the circumstances of the family had a deep impact on him and he grew up at a young age. He started working at the age of just 13. Nana Patekar also shared how, while doing small jobs, he started doing theatre and from there his journey to Bollywood began.\nNana Patekar made his debut with Gaman but his breakthrough came after the release of the 1986 sleeper hit Ankush. Over the years, Nana Patekar worked in several memorable films including Parinda, Tirangaaa, Krantiveer, Agni Sakshi, Khamoshi, and Bhoot.\nOne of his most special films was Karisma Kapoor and Sanjay Kapoor starrer Shakti, which was released in 2002, in which he played the role of Karisma Kapoor's father-in-law. Shah Rukh Khan also made an appearance in this film.\nAs for his personal life, Nana Patekar married Neelkanti at age 27. When he turned 28, Nana Patekar's father died of a heart attack and later he also lost his first son.\nNana Patekar likes to lead a simple life, away from the limelight but has successfully established himself financially, securing his and his family's futures. As per media reports, Nana Patekar's estimated net worth is Rs 80 crore. He also charges Rs 2-3 crore per film.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

They were taken aback and they were worried that I might be overshadowed by Aamir's larger-than-life persona.\"\nAman Wadhwa\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 02:41 PM IST | Edited by : Aman Wadhwa\nIn a candid conversation about her marriage, creative journey, and personal evolution, Kiran Rao, the former wife of Bollywood superstar Aamir Khan, shared some invaluable insights into her life as a South Indian middle-class woman married to one of India's most famous actors. Her honest reflections on their relationship, their creative collaborations, and the dynamics of their family are as inspiring as they are thought-provoking.\nWhen asked about her parents' reaction to her decision to marry Aamir Khan, Kiran was refreshingly honest. \"It was a shocker for them,\" she admitted in an interview with ANI. \"They were taken aback. In their eyes, I had a lot of promise. I was someone who wanted to do a lot of things, and they were worried that I might be overshadowed by Aamir's larger-than-life persona,\" she added.\nIndeed, Aamir Khan's fame can be overwhelming, and Kiran with her independent spirit, felt the pressure. But what she found most comforting was Aamir's acceptance of her as her own person. \"Aamir has never expected me to be a certain way. He has always been happy for me to be myself, and that's one of the greatest things about him,\" Kiran shared.\nReflecting on the recent wedding of Aamir's daughter, Ira Khan, to Nupur Shikhare, Kiran shared beautiful insights about their blended family. Kiran, who has always been incredibly close to Aamir's children from his first marriage, sees their bond as an organic result of the kindness and warmth Aamir fosters in his family. \"His family is incredibly warm. So it happens quite organically,\" she said. \"His friends, who've known him since childhood, have become family. Once introduced to the family, those relationships continue to stay strong, even as individuals,\" she explained.\nFor Kiran, the key to their family dynamic has been acceptance and unconditional support. \"The family accepts you as a person, not just in a role,\" she added, emphasizing that both her and Aamir's children--his son Junaid and daughter Ira--have grown up with a sense of inclusion and love. It's a family that extends beyond blood ties, with even Nupur Shikhare, Ira's husband, becoming part of the larger family fabric.\nBut Kiran's journey has not always been easy. The initial challenge of being in the shadow of Aamir Khan's fame was real. The weight of public expectation, combined with the pressure to maintain her identity, was a constant struggle as she said, \"When you marry someone incredibly famous, you do lose a part of your own identity,\" Kiran confessed, adding, \"It took me a long time to find my own voice again.\"\nFor Kiran, regaining her sense of self wasn't just about public recognition but also about personal fulfillment. She admitted that it was only after some time that she could step out of Aamir's shadow and feel comfortable in her own identity. \"It wasn't just about reclaiming my public identity, but also about personal terms. Aamir allowed me to grow into my own person, to evolve, and it was because of him that I found the courage to say, 'I love you, I love this family, but I need to be on my own.'\"\nDespite their separation in 2021, Kiran and Aamir have maintained a respectful and supportive relationship, both personally and professionally. \"We have been able to work together creatively. It shows maturity on both our parts. It's not always easy - creative work can get heated - but that's what makes the collaboration so fulfilling,\" Kiran explained.\nKiran's own film production company, Kindling Pictures, has already made its mark, producing Laapataa Ladies. However, she continues to work with Aamir Khan Productions, underscoring their ongoing professional camaraderie. \"Aamir and I will always be there for each other,\" she concluded, reflecting on their ability to balance family, career, and creativity without acrimony.\nKiran Rao, Indian film producer and director, was married to Bollywood superstar Aamir Khan for over 15 years. The couple tied the knot in 2005 and had a son, Azad Rao Khan, in 2011. However, in July 2021, they announced their separation and decision to divorce, citing a desire to continue their individual journeys and co-parent their son. Despite their divorce, both Kiran and Aamir have maintained a cordial relationship and continue to support each other's professional endeavors.\nExcept for the headline, this story has not been edited by DNA staff and is published from ANI\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "WORLD\nThe massive deposit, located beneath the soil of Folswiller in the Moselle region, is estimated to hold 46 million tonnes of hydrogen\nShivam Verma\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 09:01 AM IST\nFrance has made a big discovery in green energy with the largest known natural hydrogen reserve on the planet. The massive deposit, located beneath the soil of Folswiller in the Moselle region, is estimated to hold 46 million tonnes of hydrogen. According to reports, the value of this reserve is around $92 trillion, with expectations that its worth will rise in the future.\nThis discovery, made by researchers from the Georesources Laboratory and CNRS, was unexpected.\nScientists were originally searching for methane but instead found an enormous supply of white hydrogen buried 1,250 meters underground. This form of hydrogen is a potential game-changer as it provides a clean energy source without carbon emissions.\nUnlike green hydrogen, which requires electricity from renewable sources for production, or grey hydrogen, which is derived from fossil fuels and contributes to pollution, white hydrogen is naturally occurring. It is found deep underground and does not require complex industrial processes or generate harmful emissions.\nCurrently, the world\u2019s hydrogen economy faces challenges due to high production costs and dependency on fossil fuels. White hydrogen presents a cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative. If similar reserves are found elsewhere, it could spark a global shift toward sustainable energy.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

The mail started coming in as early as 4 a.m.  The threats prompted immediate action from the authorities, and schools were searched across Delhi. While no evidence of danger has been uncovered so far, law enforcement officials remain vigilant. An investigation is also launched to trace the origin of the email, which, prima facie, appears to have been sent from Russia.

        "French President Emmanuel Macron says Russia's aggression 'knows no borders'",
        "WORLD\nAs per Al Jazeera, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Macron's speech in which he called Russia a threat to France and Europe was \"extremely confrontational\".\nSrishty Choudhury\nUpdated : Mar 07, 2025, 04:23 PM IST\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday said Russian aggression \"knows no borders\" and is a direct threat to Europe as European Union leaders prepare to hold emergency talks in Brussels in the wake of the Trump administration's stance on transatlantic ties, Al Jazeera reported.\u00a0\"Who can believe that this Russia of today will stop at Ukraine?\" Macron said in a televised address late on Wednesday, as per Al Jazeera.\n\r\n\tIn a post on X, Macron said, \"Our generation will no longer receive the peace dividend. It is up to us to ensure that our children reap the dividends of our commitments tomorrow. So we will face it, together.\"\n\r\n\tMacron warned that Europe must be prepared to stand alone in the face of Russian aggression. \"I want to believe the US will stay by our side,\" said Macron. \"But we have to be ready if that isn't the case.\"\n\r\n\t\"The future of Europe does not have to be decided in Washington or Moscow,\" he added.\nMacron added that he plans next week to hold a meeting of army chiefs from European countries willing to send troops to Ukraine after any eventual peace deal with Russia, as per Al Jazeera.\nMacron also said he would discuss with his European partners extending French nuclear deterrence to other countries on the continent, but that the decision and control would continue to remain in the French president's hands.\n\"France will follow only one course: that of the will for peace and freedom, faithful to its history and its principles. The homeland needs you and your commitment,\" Macron said in a post on X.\nAs per Al Jazeera, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Macron's speech in which he called Russia a threat to France and Europe was \"extremely confrontational\".\nThe speech indicates that France is thinking about \"continuing the war\". Macron did not say anything about NATO's expansion towards Russia's borders, as per Kremlin.\n\r\n\t\"One can conclude that France thinks more about war, about continuing the war,\" said Peskov.\nThe conflict is a \"proxy war between nuclear powers\" - the US helping Ukraine and Russia - and it needs to come to an end, Al Jazeera quoted the Kremlin as saying.\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by DNA staff and is published from ANI)\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "BOLLYWOOD\nAfter Urvashi Rautela, Yami Gautam, and Pulkit Samrat-starrer Sanam Re was panned by critics and audiences in 2016, Divya Khosla Kumar has never directed a film in the last nine years.\nAman Wadhwa\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 02:20 PM IST | Edited by : Aman Wadhwa\nThe 2016 romantic drama Sanam Re, directed by Divya Khosla Kumar, was led by Pulkit Samrat, Yami Gautam, and Urvashi Rautela. One of the videos from the promotional interviews of the film has now resurfaced on social media, in which Urvashi is saying that she was the \"first\" to join the film, similar to her other \"first\" claims, and she is hilariously interrupted by Yami and Pulkit.\nTalking to Box Office India, Urvashi said, \"I was the first one to join the cast. That time the cast wasn\u2019t decided, who is going to play what.\" Yami interrupted and stated, \"That\u2019s what was told to everybody. We all were on board.\" Pulkit further jokingly added, \"Mujhse wo puch rahe the, Ye kaisi hai, ye kaisi hai (They were asking me. How is she? How is her as the heroine?).\nReacting to them, Urvashi added, \"So maybe she (Divya Khosla Kumar) kept it under wraps or whatever. So yeah, I signed that time. That\u2019s how it all started. A lot of people believe that I got it because of Love Dose, the song with Yo Yo Honey Singh, the international music video.\" Pulkit again interrupted and stated, \"You were so bad in that, Urvashi. How can you get it because of that?\". Urvashi stated, \"People do tell me that. I mean I signed this movie first. It somehow came later. That\u2019s how it happened. I have a very wonderful association with them. I did a song \u2018Daddy Mummy\u2019. I have 3 movie deal with them. This is the first film, and I am really excited about it. And Im also happy with the character which I am playing. It\u2019s a treat to work with her. She is an amazing director.\"\nA post shared by Bollywood ORRYginals (@thebollywoodorryginals)\nApart from Urvashi, Yami, and Pulkit, Sanam Re also featured Rishi Kapoor, Prachi Shah, Bharti Singh, and Manoj Joshi in key roles. Made in Rs 25 crore, Sanam Re earned Rs 27 crore net in India and grossed Rs 38 crore worldwide. The film was panned by the critics and audiences. After the 2016 movie, Divya Khosla Kumar has never directed a movie in the last nine years.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "Alia Bhatt says daughter Raha is 'the new girlfriend in family', shares how Ranbir Kapoor bonds with her: 'They both have...'",
        "BOLLYWOOD\nTalking about Ranbir Kapoor's relationship with their daughter Raha, Alia Bhatt said, \"Their bond is like they\u2019re two friends - either two adults or two toddlers, you know, different at different moments in life.\"\nAman Wadhwa\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 08:36 AM IST | Edited by : Aman Wadhwa\nAlia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor tied the knot on April 14 in 2022 and welcomed their baby daughter Raha on November 6 in the same year. In her recent interview, the Gangubai Kathiawadi actress called Raha \"the new girlfriend in the family\" and also talked about the special connection that Ranbir shares with their daughter.\nTalking to YouTuber Jay Shetty on his podcast On Purpose, Alia shared how her life has changed after Raha's birth as she said, \"Now everything has changed because now I have a daughter, so now it's like there's a new girlfriend in the family. I become very childlike when I am with her. The one thing I am mindful about is to enjoy her childhood. I try to be present with Raha, which is something I don\u2019t do with other moments in my life. I am always 10 steps ahead otherwise, but with her, I try to be present and in the moment it happens more naturally because I want to enjoy every second.\"\nTalking about how she feels Ranbir has changed after Raha's birth, Alia added, \"When he looks at Raha, there are stars in his eyes. Of course, (that\u2019s true) for any parents. But when I see it, because I\u2019ve known Ranbir before and I know him now, I see the difference. I see the difference in the way he is with people, you know, as a father. He\u2019s just so sort of full. It\u2019s not like he was ever edgy. He always had a very calm demeanour, but there\u2019s a fullness which I experienced first-hand and that I see on a daily basis, and it\u2019s actually really sweet and special to watch their conversations. He\u2019s very creative when it comes to entertaining her. She entertains him as well, like they both have a very special friendship, I would say. Their bond is like they\u2019re two friends - either two adults or two toddlers, you know, different at different moments in life.\"\nMeanwhile, Alia Bhatt will next be seen in the action thriller Alpha. Slated to release on December 25 on Christmas, the upcoming film is the seventh installment in the YRF Spy Universe after Ek Tha Tiger, Tiger Zinda Hai, War, Pathaan, Tiger 3, and War 2. The actress is also currently shooting for Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Love & War, which also stars Ranbir Kapoor and Vicky Kaushal, and is scheduled to release on March 20, 2026.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

The incredible story of a farmer from Nashik, Sangita Pingale, who lost her husband and child, rebuilt her life through farming.\nVaishali Shastri\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 11:51 AM IST\nSuccess story of Sangita Pingale: Women entrepreneurs and the success stories of women in India are rich with determination and resilience. From fashion, finance, to even farming women have shown excellence in every field. Among many inspiring stories of Indian businesswomen, is the story of a woman farmer. The incredible story of a farmer from Nashik, Maharashtra, Sangita Pingale, who lost her husband and child and inspite of the fact that farming is mainly dominated by men, she rebuilt her life through farming and proved that women in farming can be successful.\nSangita Pingale was born into a farming family in a small village called Shilapur in the Nashik district of Maharashtra. Even though she belonged to a farming family, Sangita had a passion for studying since childhood and went on to earn a bachelor's degree in chemistry in 2000. She had dreams of becoming a government official and even when her father completely supported her in her goals, her destiny had a different path planned for her.\nSoon after her college education, she was married to Anil Pingale in 2000. Anil Pingale was a progressive farmer from the village of Matore. To make a better life after marriage, she supported her husband as a homemaker worked hard for the family. A year after her marriage, in 2001, she gave birth to a daughter but lost her father, which was a huge blow to Sangita. In 2004, their son was born, but he was disabled and passed away five years later which was another big blow to her. Despite all these hardships, Sangita did not lose her courage.\nIn 2007, another tragic event occurred when her husband Anil died in a road accident. At that time, Sangita was nine months pregnant, and 15 days later, she gave birth to a son. The joy of the arrival of the new life seemed small in the face of her deep sorrow.\nSangita received 13 acres of land in 2016, after the family\u2019s possessions were being divided. Despite having no experience in farming and facing society's taunts, she did not give up. After initial guidance from her father-in-law, Sangita began to learn the intricacies of farming. Three months later, her father-in-law also passed away, and Sangita took on the responsibility of farming alone.\nShe mortgaged property to buy a scooter and started commuting to the fields. After a successful tomato harvest, she decided to cultivate grapes. Gradually, her hard work paid off, and she began producing 800-1,000 tons of grapes annually, earning an income of 25-30 lakh rupees.\nToday, her daughter is pursuing higher education, and her son is studying in a private school. According to Sangita, \u201cI have proven my critics wrong.\u201d Her story is an inspiration for women who are fighting social constraints and personal challenges. Sangita Pingale's life is proof that with determination and hard work, the impossible can be made possible.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "BOLLYWOOD\nHeadlined by Amitabh Bachchan and Hema Malini, Baghban was rejected by the distributors. The film did not have a good run in the theatres in the first four days, but later picked up. Salman Khan's cameo saved the film, which went on to become a blockbuster in 2003.\nAman Wadhwa\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 01:34 PM IST | Edited by : Aman Wadhwa\nDirected by Ravi Chopra, the 2003 film Baghban featured Amitabh Bachchan and Hema Malini in the leading roles. Salman Khan and Mahima Chaudhry were also seen making cameo appearances in the family drama. In a recent interview, the late filmmaker's wife Renu Chopra shared how the makers faced challenges while making and distributing the film.\nSpeaking to Pinkvilla, she said, \"Despite the film being ready, no distributor wished to take up Baghban. They called it old-fashioned and this was a time when Amit ji was on a decline and had just made a comeback with Mohabbatein and KBC. They all said no one would touch it.\" She further shared how Salman Khan's cameo saved the film as she continued, \"Then someone suggested bringing Salman Khan on board for a guest appearance - the only part left to shoot. Ravi knew Salman, but not as well as we do now. Ravi went to his house to meet him. Salman lives in a two-room apartment and is the simplest man. The three Khan brothers were in the gym and one by one, they came out wearing shorts, making Ravi ji feel overdressed.\"\n\"Then Salman came out, heard his role and immediately agreed to do the film. He said, 'I love this boy (Alok Malhotra, the character he eventually played). My concept of my parents is exactly this. I worship them and I will do the role.' He did not ask how much we would pay him and simply asked where he needed to come for the shoot\", Renu added.\nShe then recalled the experience of shooting with Salman for Baghban in London. Renu stated that Salman just made the request of not starting the work before 11 am. \"He promised he wouldn\u2019t leave until everything was done. Every evening, he\u2019d invite us for dinner, and you couldn\u2019t tell him what to order. He\u2019d take over and order the entire menu. On the last day, when we tried to clear the bill, we discovered Salman had already paid it\", she said.\nRenu Chopra also stated how the film saw no major footfall in theatres in the first four days but gained momentum from its fifth day. She shared, \"Baghban did not have a good run on its first four days (Friday-Monday) in theatres. Ravi wondered why he made that film. But its fate changed on Tuesday and the movie picked up.\"\nMade in Rs 10 crore, Baghban went on to become a blockbuster and earned Rs 45 crore gross worldwide. It became the fifth-highest grossing Bollywood film of 2023 behind Kal Ho Naa Ho, Koi Mil Gaya, The Hero: Love Story of a Spy, and Chalte Chalte. The Ravi Chopra directorial also starred Aman Verma, Samir Soni, Saahil Chadha, Nasir Khan, Suman Ranganathan, Divya Dutta, Arzoo Govitrikar, Paresh Rawal, Rimi Sen, Lillete Dubey, and Asrani in pivotal roles.\u00a0The film has also gained a cult status over the years after its re-runs on television.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

Speaking at the India Today Conclave, she revealed how harsh judgments about her appearance impacted her deeply, expressing hope that societal attitudes will improve for future generations.\nNamita recalled being teased at school for her weight, acne, and facial hair. A particularly hurtful memory involved a boy mocking her as \"the girl with the moustache\" in Marathi, which left a lasting mark on her self-esteem. \"Those words stayed with me. It was tough growing up with constant criticism about my looks,\" she said.\nThis isn't the first time Namita has spoken about her struggles. In a podcast with author Chetan Bhagat, she shared that she battled emotional eating for 40 years. Food, especially sugary treats, became a source of comfort for her. \"When I felt hurt, I turned to food. It became a coping mechanism,\" she admitted.\nNamita's challenges began in school, where bullying over her appearance made her feel unattractive and insecure. She described how being called names like moti (meaning \"fat\" in Hindi) and the remarks about her facial hair took a toll on her mental health. These experiences led to a difficult journey with body image and confidence.\nFrom Bullying to Business Success\nDespite her early struggles, Namita went on to achieve tremendous success. Born into a conservative Gujarati family, she now holds a net worth of around Rs 600 crores. She earns primarily through her role at Emcure Pharmaceuticals but also has multiple income streams. These include her own business ventures, earnings from her role on Shark Tank India, and returns from her investment portfolio.\nNamita's story is a powerful reminder of how childhood experiences can shape a person. However, her success also highlights the possibility of overcoming hardships and finding strength. She continues to inspire many by openly discussing her journey, showing that success is not just about business acumen but also about resilience and self-acceptance.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

Missing this deadline means losing the opportunity to correct errors and report omitted income.\nTax-saving investments | For taxpayers, March 31, 2025, is the last date to invest and claim deductions. Key deductions under the Income Tax Act include: Section 80C: Investments in PPF, ELSS, NSC, and life insurance premiums (limit of \u20b91.5 lakh per year);\u00a0 Section 80D: Health insurance premium deductions; Section 24(b): Home loan interest deductions; NPS Contributions (80CCD(1B)): Additional \u20b950,000 deduction. Missing the deadline could result in higher tax liabilities for those following the old tax regime.\nUAN activation for EPFO members | Employees under the Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) must activate their Universal Account Number (UAN) by March 15, 2025, to avail of insurance benefits under the Employees\u2019 Deposit Linked Insurance (EDLI) scheme. The scheme offers insurance coverage of up to \u20b97 lakh for EPF members. If UAN activation is pending, members risk losing insurance benefits.\nNew nomination rules for mutual funds and demat accounts | Effective March 1, 2025 SEBI has revised nomination rules for mutual funds and demat accounts to ensure a smooth transfer of assets. Key changes include: Investors can nominate up to 10 individuals. Nomination is mandatory for single-holder accounts to prevent unclaimed assets. Required nominee details include PAN, last four digits of Aadhaar, or a driving license number. Investors must provide the nominee\u2019s contact details, relationship with the account holder, and date of birth (if the nominee is a minor). For joint accounts, assets will transfer automatically to the surviving account holder under the survivorship rule.\nUPI payment rule change for insurance premiums | UPI users will be able to pay insurance premiums using blocked amounts under the Bima-ASBA facility. This feature will ensure that policyholders' funds remain blocked until the insurer accepts the policy proposal. If the insurer rejects the proposal, the blocked amount will be automatically unblocked. This move will be available this month."

        "What is D-Remit in National Pension System?",
        "D-Remit, a crucial feature in the National Pension System (NPS), \u00a0allows subscribers to transfer funds from one NPS account to another seamlessly. This facility helps in simplifying the process for subscribers who wish to move their accumulated funds between different pension accounts. D-Remit is primarily designed for those who switch jobs, change locations, or opt for a different pension fund manager.\nSimplifying Fund Transfers for Subscribers\nD-Remit enables subscribers to seamlessly transfer their accumulated NPS funds without any disruptions. This eliminates the need for the traditional, cumbersome process that once required manual paperwork and involved multiple steps. The feature is intended to ensure continuity in retirement savings, which is crucial for individuals who frequently change jobs or relocate across the country.\nBenefits of D-Remit\nHow D-Remit Works\nUnder D-Remit, subscribers can request a transfer of funds from one NPS account to another through their current NPS account holder or the new account manager. This system reduces the complications involved in manual transfer requests and offers a more streamlined process. Subscribers simply need to initiate the transfer from their online account, making the process far more accessible and convenient.\nRole in NPS Growth and Accessibility\nD-Remit is seen as an important step towards increasing the flexibility and reach of NPS, especially for those working in the private sector or frequently moving across different geographical locations. By simplifying the transfer process, it encourages individuals to invest in NPS with more confidence, knowing that their retirement savings will not be hindered due to job or location changes.\nIn recent years, the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA)\u00a0has been working on several initiatives to make NPS more accessible, with D-Remit being one of the key steps in improving subscriber experience. The system is expected to make it easier for new and existing subscribers to stay enrolled in NPS, improving overall participation in the scheme."

        "13 Tweets To Read Before Streaming \u2018Black Warrant\u2019 On Netflix",
        "After a not-so-great year for the Indian OTT space in 2024, the new year starts with a promising new show. Created by Vikramaditya Motwane and Satyanshu Singh, Black Warrant has dropped on Netflix and the internet can\u2019t stop raving about it.\nThe show tells the stories from arguably the best-known prison in the country \u2013 Tihar jail. It is based on the book Black Warrant: Confessions of a Tihar Jailer, co-written by the former jailer of Tihar, Sunil Gupta. In its bold and harrowing revelations, Black Warrant presents the controversial procedural lapses and the corruption that existed in the legal and judicial system.\nIn telling the stories of real-life infamous criminals like Charles Sobhraj and Ranga-Billa, the show eerily reminded me of the show Mindhunter (of course, if it was set inside an Indian jail with all its travesty and corruption). Here\u2019s a glimpse into what Twitter has to say about the show starring Zahan Kapoor as Sunil Gupta, Rahul Bhat, Paramvir Singh Cheema, Anurag Thakur among others.\nAfter the peak era of web shows 4-5 years ago, Black Warrant is easily one of the best I've seen in a long time. pic.twitter.com/f841dB2buX\nBlack Warrant On Netflix Is Highly Recommended. pic.twitter.com/xIoUSEXLfn\nBlack Warrant is @NetflixIndia \u2018s best original series since Sacred Games season 1. Wow!! Vikramaditya Motwane is a genius who simply never misses. pic.twitter.com/Oe1bxG2Bsj\nTwo years ago, the book hooked me instantly. Now on Netflix, Black Warrant is immersive, detailed, and brilliantly acted.\npleased to announce that black warrant fkin slaps. a long format victory we haven't seen in agesgod bless vikram motwane & team. pic.twitter.com/xTNNDMgrNp\nShashi Kapoor would have been immensely proud. A star is born! #ZahanKapoor pic.twitter.com/Tq70yj4NPX\n6 min into #BlackWarrant and bbgorl Siddhant Gupta shows up as Charles Sobhraj?? So many unholy thoughts in my head istg \ud83e\udee6 pic.twitter.com/gEhqMggbCr\nBlack warrant was fantastic.. thoroughly enjoyed it. Stories so fascinating i went and searched more about all the people hanged lol. Do watch the series! Zahan makes impressive debut, Rahul as usual owns every scene he is in. Terrific performer. #BlackWarrant pic.twitter.com/uhjUIf6YMB\n#BlackWarrant was good. Liked Motwane's adaption. The visuals are so good, one of those shows where not a single performance is off. Zahan Kapoor, smashing debut this. pic.twitter.com/buDgKTnwV9\nBlack warrant is a must watch. Return of Bingeable Indian content on Netflix finally and that too by Motwane.\nthe ranga billa episode of Black Warrant is harrowing..masterful\nNetflix finally has a winner in #BlackWarrant. The 2nd episode directed by Vikram Motwane is the one to watch out for & how I wish he directed it all not just 3 eps but probably as creator you have to give chance to other directors too.Little dark,gripping & fantastically done. pic.twitter.com/sD4e3sOYXq\nblack warrant had me shocked to figure out zahaan is from the Kapoor family \u2014 so unassuming and what a fantastic actor\nAfter so long, an Indian OTT show has garnered universal acclaim and love. With shows like Black Warrant, we hope this year becomes a great one for us, the viewers, and the filmmakers."

        "The News Is Out! Diljit Dosanjh is Officially The Global Brand Ambassador For Levi\u2019s & We\u2019re Losing Our Minds!",
        "Doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re Gen Z, millennial, or still vibing with your radio-era nostalgia\u2014if you\u2019re Indian, you love Diljit Paaji. Whether it\u2019s his chartbusters or his scene-stealing acting, this man has the whole nation grooving to his charm. And just when we thought he couldn\u2019t level up, Levi\u2019s has come through with a major announcement\u2014Diljit Paaji is now their brand ambassador! Yup, the G.O.A.T. singer, actor, and style icon is the new face of Levi\u2019s, and we think this collab is Born To Shine!\nYou see, Diljit Dosanjh isn\u2019t just a star\u2014he\u2019s a cultural phenomenon. From his chart-topping music to his jaw-dropping outfits, Paaji has always known how to strike a chord with the youth of India (and beyond). So it\u2019s no wonder Levi\u2019s, the OG of denim and a symbol of authenticity, has chosen him as their new brand ambassador.\u00a0 With this partnership, they\u2019ve given us yet another reason to celebrate Diljit\u2019s unstoppable reign.\nBut why is Diljit Dosanjh THE Perfect Fit For Levi\u2019s?\nLevi\u2019s has always been the poster child of individuality and self-expression, and Diljit is the king of keeping it real. Whether he\u2019s blessing us with iconic Punjabi hits or serving bold looks with his statement jackets, Diljit knows how to make authenticity his signature while making us fall in love with his down-to-earth attitude! Both Levi\u2019s and Diljit stand for one thing: staying true to yourself is the ultimate flex\u2014whether through classic denim or chart-topping Punjabi beats.\nAnd don\u2019t we all agree that Diljit is more than just an entertainer\u2014he\u2019s a whole movement! His mix of desi swag and global style is definitely a trend we can all get behind. So, this partnership is nothing short of historic with both Levi\u2019s and Diljit taking bold new steps to celebrate creativity, champion a progressive spirit, and break new grounds. So, if you ask us, Diljit and Levi\u2019s? Definitely a match made in fashion and music heaven!\nAlso, what sets Diljit apart from the crowd of global stars is his fearless approach to experimenting with new styles. Much like Levi\u2019s timeless yet ever-evolving denim designs, Diljit strikes that perfect balance between staying rooted in his culture and pushing boundaries with his fashion choices. He\u2019s not just a modern icon\u2014he\u2019s the one rewriting the rulebook on what it means to blend tradition with cutting-edge style.\nAs the pioneer of the one-of-a-kind blue jeans, Levi\u2019s has been a go-to for changemakers, risk-takers, and creatives for over 170 years. It\u2019s safe to say that Levi\u2019s has been killing the music-fashion crossover game for years. Now with Diljit on board, they are proving once again that they know exactly how to keep it fresh, relevant, and downright legendary.\nA post shared by Instagram (@instagram)\nWe\u2019re honestly excited to see Diljit in those iconic Levi\u2019s fits and get more fashion inspiration on how to shine like Diljit wherever we go! But till then, make sure you\u2019re following Levi\u2019s for all the latest updates. Trust us, you don\u2019t want to miss a thing!"

Someone will inevitably declare, \u201cMen have it so easy!\u201d while another counters with, \u201cTry being a woman for a day!\u201d.\nBut recently, a user on r/AskReddit asked the question \u2013 Men; why do you like being a man? and the responses were both illuminating and unintentionally hilarious. But more than that, it shows why they really don\u2019t want to be a woman. \u201cNo periods.\u201d \u201cI can walk alone at night without worrying.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m never judged for my body hair.\u201d\nWhile most answers were delivered with humor, they inadvertently painted a picture of just how hard it is to be a woman.

Directed by Rosshan Andrrews, making his Hindi directorial debut, the action thriller also features Pooja Hegde and Pavail Gulati in pivotal roles. Deva is a remake of Andrrews\u2019s 2013 Malayalam film Mumbai Police, with notable changes to its climax.\nPortraying the role of a brilliant and ambitious police officer Dev Ambre, Shahid tries to uncover a deep web of deceit and betrayal while solving a high-profile case.

I love Shahid Kapoor but the movie was too long and too slow to even become watchable. Few shots here and there were good but that\u2019s about it. I was expecting a gripping story which it wasn\u2019t. #Deva\nDeva is a slow-paced investigative thriller with a little confusing plot, loose screenplay, and underwhelming background score. Wanted to give it 2.5 stars, but Shahid Kapoor\u2019s mind-blowing performance, raw intensity, and magnetic screen presence earn it an extra 0.5.

        "10 People Who Have Worked For The Ambani Family Reveal What\u2019s It Like Being Employed By Them",
        "The lives of the rich are often hidden from plebians like us. We can only fathom what they live like and how they go about their daily lives. So when we found this Reddit thread on the Mumbai subreddit where people who have worked in Mukesh Ambani\u2019s Antilia shared their experiences, it felt like we were close to unravelling a mystery. The responses people shared are unexpectedly enlightening.\nLet\u2019s take a look, shall we?\n1. \u201cWe are expecting a work order soon. Regarding pay, they are good paymasters; provided that you have all your documents and stuff and compliance as per their norms.\u201d \u2013 mohattar\n2. \u201cA friend used to work for them and I heard this from her. Apparently, Nita Ambani sleeps in the morning/noon and wakes up late in the night and that\u2019s when their day starts. All meetings with her used to be at 12 midnight or 1 AM and stuff. I\u2019ve heard from someone who works with their cousins that they\u2019re very particular about watching a movie together every night as a family. Cute.\u201d \u2013 Legitimate-Work5329\n3. \u201cBack when I was a hospitality student, I got to work in Antilia for an event. We were paid \u20b92500 for a six-hour shift and it was a three-day event. We didn\u2019t have to do much, just had to serve almonds, ice creams, appetizers, juices, etc. to guests. Their criteria, however, was very intricate. We had to undergo a full body checkup and COVID tests. They even put us in a hotel nearby for a week before the event as quarantine.\u201d \u2013 archieshahh\n4. \u201cWe had this building security guard a few months back. His elder brother used to/still working at Antilia in the admin department. They\u2019re good paymasters and also very generous in terms of helping the people working for them.\u201d \u2013 RareTranslator1047\nCheck Out \u2013 Indian luxury brands\n5. \u201cMost of the year, they do not live there. They are either travelling or are at their UK home, only the elder son and his wife are at Antilia. Nita and Mukesh only come whenever there is an event.\u201d \u2013 Patient_Box_9572\nAlso Read- Why The Ambani Residence Costs A Whopping $2 Billion: 13 Facts That Will Mess With Your Head\n6. \u201cThere is an entire floor dedicated to the maintenance of Ambani\u2019s vehicle. It\u2019s a well-known fact that the building has six parking floors, but there is one additional floor which is totally reserved for Akash Ambani\u2019s personal vehicles.\u201d \u2013 TrickySandwich0\n7. \u201cThis gym trainer of mine and his team were picked up in the morning and then had to be seated and wait for them to arrive. They usually showed up late, often taking hours to come.\u201d \u2013 Scientifichuman\n8. \u201cA friend of mine interned at a company which supplied motors for water. Once he went in there with a senior for maintenance, his job was to see and learn. One thing he told me was that they applied stickers to his camera, which change colours when removed. It was pre-covid, so it was apparently smooth for him.\u201d \u2013 sunny9911\n9. \u201cMy ex-boss worked for MDA (Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani \u2013 his team addressed him that). He told us that he behaves like an absolutely normal person who orders bhelpuri or idlis or vadapav during team meetings. He regularly attends his office strictly on time. Of course, he is not easily accessible. But many times, MDA can be seen standing in the queue for lunch at the Reliance canteen at Navi Mumbai. Needless to say, all the canteens serve the best possible vegetarian spread in a highly neat and clean environment.\u201d \u2013 Electronic-Bill-264\n10. \u201cNeeta Ambani is very sweet and loves her kids.

        "Podcast Host\u2019s Rant About North Indian Tourists In Vietnam Has The Internet Screaming \u2018Stereotype Alert\u2019",
        "A podcast host has stirred the pot on social media after sharing his less-than-pleasant encounters with North Indian tourists during his New Year trip to Vietnam.\nRavi Handa, the host of Desi FIRE Podcast, accused them of \u201cruining\u201d his travel experience, sparking a flurry of reactions online.\nRavi Handa kicked off the conversation by explaining why he skipped Goa for his New Year\u2019s getaway. \u201cGoa has too many North Indian tourists, and they ruin the experience,\u201d he said, choosing Vietnam instead. But to his dismay, he encountered what he described as \u201cbad behaviour\u201d from Indian tourists there as well.\nI went to Vietnam for the new year break, and Goa was a choice. But not for the reasons any of you people on twitter go bonkers about. Goa has too many North Indian tourists and they ruin the experience. Even in Vietnam, the only bad behavior was from North Indian tourists.\u2026 https://t.co/CHiZeVRgoT\nFrom cutting lines with excuses like \u201cHum logon ke pass special pass hai\u201d to shouting Bharat Mata Ki Jai in a crowded train, Handa claimed the loud antics were mostly from North Indians. \u201cI even stopped one at the cable car line,\u201d he added, \u201cbut arguing seemed pointless.\u201d\nNaturally, Twitter took sides faster than a tea-seller at an Indo-Pak match. Many users lashed out at Handa for stereotyping North Indians, calling his remarks \u201cracist.\u201d\n\u201cHow did you know they were North Indians?\u201d asked one user, to which Handa replied that the tourists explicitly mentioned being from NCR. Another user pointed out, \u201cThis mentality of dividing North, South, East, and West is why we can\u2019t progress as a society.\u201d\nUber racist comment \ud83e\udd2eHow did you know that misbehaving tourists were North India?You can tell everything about a person by looking at him \ud83e\udd2d\nWhile Handa\u2019s comments did raise eyebrows, they also found some support. Many North Indians chimed in, admitting they\u2019ve witnessed similar behaviour. \u201cMe, being a North Indian myself, always felt ashamed, but now it\u2019s a whole new level of shame!\u201d wrote one user.\nYep. We have to agree that we Indians don't have civics sense (including me). We need to improve. And more people coming out on SM is one such way to nudge us to improve.\nAnother added, \u201cThere was a group of North Indians on a train in Europe, making too much noise in the name of \u2018having a good time.\u2019 All the other Europeans were silent, and only these people were shouting.\u201d\nThe debate has reignited conversations about travel etiquette and the stereotypes associated with Indian tourists abroad. While some argue that bad behaviour knows no region, others believe it\u2019s time to introspect and, well, turn the volume down a notch.\nSo, what do you think? Are these stereotypes justified, or are we simply dividing ourselves further? Let us know in the comments, but, you know, quietly."

        "Here\u2019s How Much People In My Office Are Spending On Quick Commerce Apps and I Feel Like A Noob!",
        "A few days back, I shared my experience on the internet about how I spent 30k on online delivery apps in the span of 8 months and how the apps made me lazier than I was since everything was at my fingertips. I tried to point out how subconsciously these apps and their instant gratification have changed our consumption patterns so much, that we are prioritizing quick delivery over health. The internet\u2019s reaction was very interesting. Some of them were very quick to point out that convenience wasn\u2019t the problem, but my laziness and bad habits were (as if I didn\u2019t know).\nA post shared by Instagram (@instagram)\nHowever, some of them commented that my numbers were \u201crookie\u201d and that I needed to bump them up! Well, that got me thinking \u2013 how much are people actually spending on these online delivery apps? And I decided to go on a little survey in my office and it turns out, people are spending a considerable amount of money that I couldn\u2019t even have thought of.\nDuring the survey, I asked them to add all the money that they have spent on quick commerce apps like Zomato, Swiggy, Blinkit, BigBasket, Zepto, or anything that they used for groceries and supplies for the month of December. Most of them relied on these apps for groceries, but when they calculated, they themselves were shocked at how much they actually spent even if it was on essentials. Some of them agreed that it promoted unhealthy habits and they might get it cheaper if they purchased it at local stores. Take a look for yourself:\nWell, for sure I am a noob when it comes to these online spending patterns.\nPlease note that these numbers are a representation of how dependent the respondents are on these online apps and don\u2019t reveal their eating habits or ordering patterns."

        "The Fast Rising & Declining Jobs According To Data: Time To Learn Farming And AI",
        "You might be apolitical, you might not care about any form of art or sports. However, the one aspect of the news that no human can ignore is \u2018jobs\u2019. It doesn\u2019t matter if you even have your own business, everyone is affected by the job market. On the 7th of January, the World Economic Forum published its report titled \u2018Future of Jobs Report: 2025\u201d. The findings of the report are derived from surveying more than 1000 companies in the world representing 22 industry clusters.\nThe report contains the list of the fastest-growing and declining sectors of jobs in the world by the year 2030. It also predicts the job trends and their impact on various industries of the global market in the coming years. The demographic shifts and geopolitical conflicts play a huge role in this. You must have seen numerous posts on social media about which industries will dominate in the coming years. Somewhere you must be seeing farming at the top and somewhere there must be the mention of Artificial Intelligence at the top. Here\u2019s us simplifying what the report has to say.\nThe report predicts about 170 million new jobs will be created by 2030. However, approximately 92 million will be displaced during this time. This results in 78 million net new jobs formed in the world.\nIn terms of absolute numbers, the below 5 jobs will see the highest growth in demand.\nThe rapid rise in the number in the farming industry is due to the green initiatives taken by many countries for a more sustainable future. These would be followed by food processing and related trades workers; car, van, and motorcycle drivers; nursing professionals; food and beverage service workers; general and operations managers; social work and counseling professionals; project managers, university and higher education teachers; secondary education teachers; and personal care aides.\nIn terms of percentages, the following job roles are said to grow at the fastest rate in the coming decade. Owing to the AI and big data revolution, it\u2019s no wonder that there is a rapidly growing demand to secure high paychecks.\n1. Big data specialists\n2. FinTech engineers\n3. Al and machine learning specialists\n4. Software and applications developers\n5. Security management specialists\nOn the other hand, many traditional desk jobs have made it to the list of the fastest-declining jobs.\n1. Postal service clerks\n2. Bank tellers and related clerks\n3. Data entry clerks\n4. Cashiers and ticket clerks\n5. Administrative assistants and executive secretaries\nAnother job that suffers from this declining trend is that of graphic designer. With AI elevating its magic to newer heights each day, these creative professionals\u2019 job security is under serious threat.\nThe report also tells that the skills gap continues to be the most significant barrier to business transformation today. Nearly 40 percent of skills required on the job are set to change, and 63 percent of employers are already citing it as the key barrier they face.\nHowever, AI is not here to make our lives all gloomy. Relax, the zeroes and ones are not here to make you unemployed. In the list of the most required and desired skills, the most dominant ones are human skills.\nAnalytical thinking leads the charts, followed by resilience, flexibility, and agility are some of the core skills required in the coming years. This is followed by leadership and social influence, creative thinking, motivation and self-awareness, technological literacy, empathy and active listening, curiosity and lifelong learning, talent management, and service orientation and customer service.\nSo certainly upskilling ourselves in the coming years is the only way to be part of this global job market revolution. However, don\u2019t panic. As the saying goes, AI won\u2019t take your job, but a person who knows how to use it might."

        "Jagdeep Singh\u2019s \u20b948 Crore/Day Salary Is Blowing Minds, But His Journey Is Even Wilder",
        "Ever wondered what it\u2019s like to earn \u20b948 crore every single day? Well, that\u2019s just a regular day in the life of Jagdeep Singh, the founder and former CEO of Quantumscape.\nWith an annual salary of \u20b917,500 crore, Singh holds the title of the highest-paid employee in the world. But beyond the jaw-dropping numbers, his story is one of relentless ambition, innovation, and the unstoppable rise of the EV industry.\nJagdeep Singh\u2019s journey is anything but ordinary. Armed with a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Computer Science from the University of Maryland, a Master\u2019s from Stanford University, and an MBA from UC Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business, Singh laid the groundwork for a career destined for greatness.\nBefore Quantumscape, Singh cut his teeth at tech giants like Sun Microsystems and Ciena, gaining the experience that would later fuel his entrepreneurial ventures. From co-founding AirSoft to launching Infinera, Singh\u2019s career has been a masterclass in chasing the future before it arrives.\nIn 2010, Singh\u2019s career took a pivotal turn when he recognized the untapped potential of battery technology in transforming the electric vehicle industry. Enter Quantumscape, a company now leading the charge in revolutionizing EV battery innovation.\nBacked by heavyweights like Volkswagen and Bill Gates, Quantumscape became a beacon of the EV industry, pushing boundaries and delivering cutting-edge tech that\u2019s shaping the cars of tomorrow. Singh\u2019s visionary leadership didn\u2019t just make Quantumscape a success; it made him the highest-paid employee globally.\nSingh\u2019s record-breaking compensation package wasn\u2019t just handed over on a silver platter. It was tied to ambitious performance goals, a bold, multi-billion-dollar deal that reflected the immense value he brought to Quantumscape. It wasn\u2019t just about running a company; it was about transforming an industry.\nEven after stepping down as CEO in 2024, Singh\u2019s drive hasn\u2019t slowed down. Now the CEO of a stealth startup (because apparently, the EV industry wasn\u2019t enough), he\u2019s already working on disrupting new sectors.\nSo, the next time you need a little inspiration (or a reminder to update your LinkedIn profile), just think about the man who went from coding in classrooms to redefining industries, and earning \u20b948 crore a day while at it. Now, that\u2019s some real career goals!\n"

        "Indian celebrity weddings are often synonymous with grandeur, extravagant venues, designer outfits, and a star-studded guest list. However, industrialist Gautam Adani took a different approach for his son Jeet Adani\u2019s wedding, opting for simplicity over a grand spectacle.\nJeet Adani tied the knot with Diva Jaimin Shah in an intimate ceremony on February 7, 2025, at the Adani township, Shantigram, in Ahmedabad. The wedding, held at 2 PM, followed traditional Jain and Gujarati customs. Contrary to speculations of a lavish celebration, the Adani family chose a simple wedding, attended only by close friends and family.\nIn a remarkable gesture, the family not only embraced simplicity but also contributed significantly to social causes. Around INR 10,000 crore was donated towards various initiatives in healthcare, education, and skill development.\nOn February 10, 2025, Gautam Adani, Chairman of the Adani Group, announced the launch of Adani Health City (AHC), an integrated healthcare initiative under the Group\u2019s not-for-profit healthcare division.\nThe Adani Group has partnered with ITE Education Services (ITEES) of Singapore to build a skilled workforce catering to industries such as Green Energy, Manufacturing, Hi-Tech, Project Excellence, and Industrial Design. To support this vision, the Adani family has pledged over INR 2,000 crore to establish internationally benchmarked schools of excellence.\nAdani Group also collaborated with GEMS Education to help create the future of an immersive, dynamic, and responsible education system that is inclusive and accessible to all.\nAccording to Gautam Adani, he follows the philosophy of Seva over Self. He believes \u201cService is meditation, service is prayer, and service is the ultimate divine,\u201d which they promote through their various social initiatives in education, healthcare, and skill development."

        "People Share Toxic Things In Desi Culture That Are Normalized & There\u2019s So Much We Are Doing Wrong",
        "There\u2019s always a lot to love about places that we come from, they\u2019re home after all. This means that even our culture is something that we deeply love, despite the flaws; and there\u2019s no denying that there are a lot of flaws. So much of the desi culture boils down to pretending that we are better than the rest, it\u2019s as if we are constantly competing. A lot of our ideas and opinions are problematic in ways that they harm all of us. Yet, we don\u2019t let them go.\nSome people shared similar instances and ideas of our culture that are deeply toxic:\n1. \u201cThe idea that we have to respect people who are older than us \u2013 relatives and family members, solely because they\u2019re older in age. When in fact, the basis for respect should be an individual\u2019s personality \u2013 it should depend on how they are as human beings.\u201d\n\u2013 Anonymous\n2. \u201cYou cannot have a male friend without the family assuming that you\u2019re in a relationship. This is especially true for women, their friendships with men are ruined because of this regressive mindset.\n\u2013 Aaliyah Jain\n3. \u201cPeople think that there\u2019s a specific age bar to get married. So, anytime you reach anywhere nearer that age, relatives and family members start pestering you. This is pressuring and wrong.\u201d\n\u2013 Naman Issar\n4. \u201cSo many parents make it a point to show that they\u2019re doing a favour when they\u2019re there for the children. Most things they do, they do it as an obligation. The mentality that raising a child is a favour is so toxic \u2013 it\u2019s a choice. Children should not be shown that they owe their parents something because they chose to raise a child.\u201d\n\u2013 Manya\n5. \u201cOur society spends too much money on weddings. This is mostly done to show off \u2013 and it\u2019s problematic. In some cases, people start saving money for the women\u2019s wedding when they\u2019re kids. All of this for someone else, when this money could actually be used for the kids\u2019 future or as an investment.\n\u2013 Izhan Saifi\n6. \u201cGossiping is neither normal, nor okay. I don\u2019t understand why desi culture has normalized it.\u201d\n\u2013 Shantanu Ghosh\n7. \u201cThe idea that parents\u2019 love is unconditional, is flawed. They say that they\u2019ll love us for who we are, despite everything. However, it mostly comes down to their terms. They love us when we live on their terms, when we make them happy by doing things they like. They don\u2019t love us for who we are.\u201d\n\u2013 Anonymous\n8. \u201cWe can hardly take other people doing well. Everything is a competition with us, and we only feel like we are successful when other people around us aren\u2019t doing better than us. I\u2019ve hardly seen people being genuinely happy for someone else\u2019s success. This competition is ingrained in our mentality.\u201d\n\u2013 Riya Gill\n9. \u201cWe\u2019re so into pleasing others, and looking a certain way that we don\u2019t even leave situations like a death of someone close. Our rituals and the idea of having to serve \u201cgood food\u201d are deeply toxic.\u201d\n\u2013 Harshit Ailawadi\n\n10. \u201cYou\u2019re expected to follow the guidance of your elder siblings out of respect. However, sometimes that can end up having an adverse affect, especially if the siblings are either narcissistic or abusive.\u201d\n\u2013 Harshita Singh\nA lot to think about, and correct."

        "Here Are Some Reality Checks For People Who Hero-Worship Elon Musk, The Guy Who Keeps Faltering",
        "Elon Musk might have achieved several feats throughout his career, however, it is essential to step away from worshipping him like a hero and examine his actions. It is now high time to assess the man behind the massive headlines and discuss the reality.\nIn the list below, we have mentioned some compelling reasons why people should stop treating this business magnate like a hero. Read on.\n1. He\u2019s a man-child.\nFrom changing its name and charging $8 per month for blue ticks to changing the iconic blue bird to the viral doge, the man has made a joke of his micro-blogging website, Twitter. Recently, the man shared a private picture of his ex, Amber Heard, dressed as a video game character. I mean how childish and ridiculous a man can get?\n2. He has made some very insensitive statements.\nThe man, on several occasions, has said some heartless things. In 2020, he called the people \u2018dumb\u2019 to worry about the deadly coronavirus. In 2022, when Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, he came up with a bizarre list of suggestions to solve the war, through an insensitive poll on Twitter.\n3. He\u2019s sexist and homophobic.\nNeedless to mention, he also has a terrible sense of humor. In 2021, he proposed opening a school called the Texas Institute Of Technology & Science. To this, a person suggested swapping the words \u2018technology\u2019 and \u2018science\u2019. The magnate declined and said that he wanted the name to begin with the letter T \u2013 that\u2019s because the school\u2019s name makes the acronym TITS. He has also made some homophobic statements over time and made fun of people for writing pronouns in their social media bios.\n4. He has no respect for his own employees.\nIt\u2019s 2023 and the man is still promoting the toxic hustle culture. Last year, in 2022, his employees received an ultimatum from him at two in the morning which stated that their work lives would look very different now. His email said that the employees can either commit to the new \u2018hardcore culture\u2019 or leave with three months\u2019 notice. In another instance, he laid off the janitors from his office and made the employees bring their own toilet paper. He also fired an engineer over his low reach on Twitter.\nIt\u2019s high time that we stop hailing a man-child like him as a hero!"

        "HMPV Outbreak: Here\u2019s Everything You Need To Know About The Virus & Its Growth In India",
        "It has been five years since the world witnessed a global pandemic that caused seven million deaths globally. Recently, unverified videos of hospitals across China have emerged showing overcrowded emergency rooms due to the alleged spread of HMPV. The visuals, reminiscent of the early days of COVID-19 have raised global concerns, with panic among the masses.\nWhile there is no official information from the WHO regarding the cases, the internet is circulating with a lot of reports about the virus and its potential risk. Here is everything you need to know about the virus, its symptoms, transmission, treatments, prevention, and the current situation in India.\nAccording to the Cleveland Clinic, human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a virus causing symptoms similar to a cold. The cases are usually mild and children, those with weakened immune systems, and adults over the age of 65 face a higher risk of contracting such diseases. It was first identified in 2001 and generally causes both lower and upper respiratory tract infections.\nThe symptoms of HMPV are very similar to those of the common cold and include cough, fever, runny or stuffy nose, sore throat, wheezing, shortness of breath, and even rash. Severe cases can escalate to serious respiratory diseases pneumonia, asthma flare-ups, or make chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) worse, requiring medical intervention. The mild cases last for a few days or a week, whereas serious cases can last longer. People are more likely to get sick the first time, therefore children are at more risk. Later getting some immunity, they develop only mild symptoms if they the HMPV next time.\nThe spread of the virus occurs through respiratory droplets getting transferred through coughing or sneezing. It can also travel through close personal contact through handshakes or hugs or coming in direct contact with contaminated surfaces such as railings, handles, knobs, or washroom basins.\nThere aren\u2019t any antiviral medications that treat HMPV. Mild symptoms are usually manageable at home, however, serious complications require hospital admission and remain under constant care. No antibiotics have yet proven to treat HMPV, since it is a virus.\nThe transmission, however, can be prevented with care and precautions.\nAt the time of writing, India has officially reported two cases of HMPV in Bengaluru \u2013 a 3-month-old and an 8-month-old. However, the infants have no travel history. According to ICMR, \u201cIt is emphasized that HMPV is already in circulation globally, including in India, and cases of respiratory illnesses associated with HMPV have been reported in various countries.\u201d However, the top medical body also noted that India is well-equipped to handle any potential increase in illnesses. As of Friday, the Union Health Ministry also stated that it was closely monitoring the alleged outbreak of Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) in China."

        "Here Are Salaries Of Some Indian CEOs. Yeah, Even I\u2019d Work 70 Hrs For This Much",
        "Some of them tell us to work for 70 hours a week, and some tell us that even Sundays are for hustling to make money for their companies. One thing, however, remains common among these CEOs \u2013 their fat paychecks (for some of them, it\u2019s their entitlement as well). Recently, the chairman of Larsen & Toubro Mr. SN Subrahmanyan has come under fire for stating that employees must work 90 hours per week, including Sundays.\nThe netizen\u2019s reaction worsened when it was revealed that he had taken home a total salary of \u20b951 Cr in 2023-24. His remuneration for 2023-24 included a base salary of\u00a0\u20b93.6 Cr,\u00a0\u20b91.67 Cr as prerequisites, \u20b935.28 Cr as commission and retirement benefits of\u00a0\u20b910.5 Cr. According to reports, his salary is 534.57 times the median salary of the employees of L&T! Well, now we get where this motivation to motivate others to work each second of their day comes from.\nHere\u2019s a list of the top-earning CEOs and people at the helm of companies, and the figures they made in the past years. Huh, it\u2019s hard even to make sense and comprehend this amount of money.\nThe CEO of Cognizant is India\u2019s highest-paid CEO. His compensation package was \u20b9186 Cr in FY23. includes a substantial one-time stock reward valued at $20.25 million (approximately \u20b9169 Cr).\nThe former CEO of Wipro had a salary of \u20b982.4 Cr for the fiscal year 2023-2024. He was succeeded by Srinivas Pallia as CEO and Managing Director in April last year.\nApart from inviting the biggest celebrities and entrepreneurs around the world to his podcast, Nikhil is also one of the highest-earning leaders in FY23. In that period, the founder and CEO of Zerodha and Rainmatter earned \u20b972 Cr.\nThe CEO and Executive Director of Persistent Systems earned \u20b961.7 Cr last financial year. It was a significant 31% increase from the \u20b946.9 Cr that he had earned the previous year.\nThe CEO and Director of Mphasis earned \u20b959.2 Cr in FY23. The Indian-American businessman has been leading Mphasis since 2017.\nThe CEO of Infosys Salil Parekh earned \u20b956 crore last year in FY23. Despite this mammoth income, it was still a drop from the \u20b971 Cr he earned in FY22, according to reports.\nWe have previously mentioned the huge sum the chairman of Larsen & Toubro made in FY 24. However, according to some reports, he earned a commendable \u20b961.27 Cr in the previous fiscal year. Is he angry about that?\nNo wonder work-life balance seems a myth to some of them."

However, in one of India's neighbouring country itself, building a Hindu temple is prohibited. Moreover, Hindus residing there must perform a \"puja\" with complete secrecy, without drawing attention.\nNo, we're talking about Pakistan or Bangladesh - which recently witnessed violence against minority communities including the Hindus. Well, it might surprise you that this country, once home to Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms, has banned Hindu temples today.\nThe country is question is Maldives.

Despite its international workforce, Maldives imposes religious laws strictly which makes it impossible to perform Hindu \"puja\" or celebrate Hindu festivals.\nThe country, located 400-500 kms away from India, is based near Kochi, Kerala. Despite its proximity to India, the religious laws pose a stark contrast when compared with religious freedom in India.\nMaldivian constitution, amended in 2008, declared the country as a 100 per cent Muslim nation. As per the article 9 of the constitution, only a Muslim can be a Maldivian citizen. Furthermore, public displays of any non-Islamic religious practices is banned.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

For a while, I thought that it's one of those PMS conditions, which a lot of you girlies relate to. Sometimes, before our periods, our breasts do feel a little sore and lumpy\", she said.\nAssuming it a PMS condition, she further remarked that it eventually started getting bigger and developed aches. She also mentioned how the unexpected occurrence of the same took a toll on her mental health, leaving her anxious and exhausted at the same time.\n\"It was just affecting my mental health to such an extent that I was getting bad thoughts. Every time I would google, I would only come across like the worst of results\", Hazra stated.\nAnushka Hazra further shared that as the lump started getting even worse, she visited a nearby hospital and got a ultrasonography (USG) done.\n\"It is not as cool and simple as it sounds when you have to get an USG done, for a condition like this when you're only expecting the worst and second, when it is for your private area like breasts\", she said.\nHazra further said that the doctors recommended her to receive a proper treatment from a specialised doctor.\nShe remarked that the doctors even refrained from giving an assurance to her that it was not cancerous.\nHazra further shared that the cancer specialists, whom she visited, asked her to get a proper cancer test done, which is called - Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC).\n\"That was the biggest shocker of my life, the worst news that I've ever heard in my life\", she remarked.\n\"Physically, it has been the most painful thing I've ever had to go through\", she added.\nAnushka Hazra further revealed that the test reports came out negative, after which she and her parents breathed a sigh of relief.\nAlongside medications, Hazra said, she had to undergo some lifestyle changes to fight out the condition.\nWhat is fibroadenoma?\nA fibroadenoma is a non-cancerous breast lump. In very rare case, it may contain cancer. It is quite common among women and usually occurs between the age of 15 to 35, health experts opine.\nAlthough, health experts are still clueless about why it occurs in some women. But many reckon that the condition happens due to hormonal imbalance.\nSymptoms\nIf you experience a lump in either or both of your breats, it may be a sign of fibroadenoma. The lumps can be as small as a pea or even get bigger as a golf ball.\nPrevention\nIn many cases, it often shrinks or go away without treatments.

        "Kiran Rao decodes why South movies are giving Bollywood a run for its money: 'Even their horror films...'",
        "BOLLYWOOD\nKiran shared that the makers in South cinema are ready to take chances as it's a small industry, and they know their audience very well.\nVarsha Agarwal\nUpdated : Mar 08, 2025, 09:25 PM IST\nFilmmaker Kiran Rao candidly discussed the Bollywood vs South Cinema debate and said that she finds a \"sense of conviction\" when it comes to telling stories in South films.\nIn a conversation with ANI, she said, \"I watch a lot of Malayalam films, and what I'm always struck by is how they really seem very bold in their story choices. 'Uleri', which was released last year, is such a bold story idea. Even their horror films, like I saw a film called 'Bramayugam,' which is a Mammootty film, incredibly artistically made using folk tales and the folklore of Kerala, and it's a very different idea. There is a sort of a sense of conviction about telling stories that are different. And I think that's what stands them in great stead.\"\nKiran, however, shared that the makers in South cinema are ready to take chances as it's a small industry, and they know their audience very well. \"It's the chances that they are taking with the stories they are telling, and perhaps that also comes from the fact that they are usually smaller industries that are technically only catering to their own, culturally, their language and their community. And so they are quite unafraid to try different things. They know their audience, and their producers are willing to take chances on new storytelling,\" she added.\nShe said what is incredible is that \"the audience is going to watch films,\" and the makers are \"very much in touch with their audience. They understand their audience very well.\" However, she shared that Bollywood is big, and while making the movie, filmmakers keep in mind that they have to cater for a \"wider audience\". \"You are making films for a diaspora, you are making films for all the states of the country. And I think maybe that is why people want to make something that they are very sure will succeed, and maybe that's why there's a tendency to go to a film that's already successful, like a remake,\" she said. She insisted that it is important to have \"producers who are willing to take a chance\" if you are willing to have a different cinema.\nRao started her career as the assistant director in the epic film 'Lagaan', directed by Ashutosh Gowariker, whom she also assisted later on 'Swades: We, the People'. Lagaan was nominated for the 74th Academy Award in the foreign language film category. Aamir Khan produced and starred in the same film. Before 'Lagaan', she also played a minute role as a supporting actress in 'Dil Chahta Hai'.

During such quakes, loud rumbling or boom sounds are often heard.\nSagar Malik\nUpdated : Feb 17, 2025, 05:44 PM IST\nMany residents in national capital Delhi woke up in panic early on Monday morning as a strong earthquake hit the city and adjoining regions. A loud boom sound was also heard by people when the quake struck. Here\u2019s what caused the mysterious sound.\nWhat was the boom sound?\r\n\tThe earthquake that hit Delhi on Monday had a depth of about 5 kilometers, according to the National Centre of Seismology, making it a shallow-focus earthquake. During such quakes, loud rumbling or boom sounds are often heard.\nThis is because high-frequency ground vibrations from shallow earthquakes reach the atmosphere and become sound waves.\nThe shallower the earthquake\u2019s epicentre, the greater its potential to generate loud sounds.\n\u201cWhen earthquakes are deeper, those vibrations never reach the surface. Sometimes, earthquakes create booming sounds even when no vibrations are felt,\u201d according to the US Geological Survey (USGS).\nEarthquake in Delhi\r\n\tAn earthquake with a magnitude of 4 on the Richter Scale struck Delhi around 5:30 am on Monday. The epicentre of the quake was Jheel Park in Dhaula Kuan area, according to the National Center for Seismology.\nAn earthquake below 2.5 magnitude is considered \u201cmild\u201d and does not cause tremors. A quake with magnitude between 2.5 and 5.4 is labeled \u201cmoderate,\u201d causing minor tremors. Those above 5.4 magnitude are considered \u201csevere\u201d earthquakes and have the potential to cause strong tremors and damage.\nDelhi is described by experts as being at moderate to high risk of experiencing earthquakes.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

In a heartfelt message, he shared how his granddaughters have strengthened his resolve to build a world where women face no barriers in achieving their dreams. Gautam Adani spoke about the strong women who shaped his journey, including his mother, wife Priti Adani, and others that he met through his work.\nHe recalled how his mother managed their large family with resilience and how his wife's dedication to the Adani Foundation has transformed lives across rural India.\nIn a social media post he said, \"A decade ago, as I cradled my first granddaughter's delicate fingers, I made a silent vow: to help build a world where her aspirations would know no bounds, where her voice would resonate with the same respect as any man's, and where her worth would be measured solely by her character and contributions\".\nHe further added, \"Now, blessed with three beautiful granddaughters, this promise burns brighter and more urgent than ever. International Women's Day is not merely a date on the calendar; it's a poignant reminder of the strides we've made and the journey that still lies ahead. For me, this mission is deeply personal across many dimensions - as a young boy being inspired by his mother, as a business leader witnessing the challenges faced by women in leadership, as a husband inspired by my wife Priti's unwavering dedication to the Adani Foundation, and as a grandfather dreaming of a world without limits for the girls who affectionately call me \"Dadu.\"\nHe also highlighted key initiatives by the Adani Foundation, such as the Butterfly Effect framework, which supports women throughout different stages of life, and the Lakhpati Didis program, which has helped over 1,000 women achieve financial independence.\nHe said \"Moreover, our 'Lakhpati Didis' initiative celebrates over 1,000 women who have achieved financial independence through enhanced entrepreneurial skills\". Gautam Adani shared a personal experience of visiting one of his company's ports, where he noticed the lack of women in leadership roles. This led him to push for change, ensuring policies were more inclusive and providing mentorship opportunities for women.\nHe added, \"Several years ago, during a visit to one of our port projects, I noticed the absence of women in operational and leadership roles. It was not due to a lack of capability but rather the absence of pathways for them into these traditionally male-dominated fields. This realization sparked a personal commitment to change\".\nDespite progress, he acknowledged that many women still face challenges in leadership roles. He expressed hope that his granddaughters would one day enter boardrooms where they are valued as equals.\nGautam Adani said, \"Yet, beneath that pride is a quiet impatience. Because despite how far we have come, my granddaughters may still enter boardrooms where they are the only women at the table. They may still have to fight harder, speak louder, and prove themselves twice over to receive the recognition they deserve. They may still face doors that open too slowly, or not at all\".\nFor his granddaughters he added \"And to my granddaughters, who may one day read this: My dearest girls, The world you inherit should be one where your brilliance is met with open doors, not glass ceilings. Where your ambitions are never questioned, only encouraged. Where your voice is not just heard, but sought after. I vow to keep pushing, to keep breaking barriers, until that world is not just a vision but a reality. Because you, and every girl like you, deserve to walk into every room knowing you belong. Your Dadu.\"\nConcluding his message, he urged men in leadership positions to see gender equality as a shared responsibility, stating, \"The talents, insights, and leadership of women are invaluable resources we cannot afford to squander.\n\"This year's International Women's Day theme, Accelerate Action, resonates deeply with vision of creating an inclusive future where every woman can thrive\".\nExcept for the headline, the story has not been edited by DNA staff and is published from ANI.\n\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "INDIA\nIn a surprising turn of events in Madhya Praesh's Ratlam, a man, deemed to be in coma, walked out of the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) on his own and exposed an alleged medical fraud done by the private hospital where he was admitted.\nMeemansa Shekhawat\nUpdated : Mar 08, 2025, 07:32 AM IST\nIn a surprising turn of events in Madhya Praesh's Ratlam, a man, deemed to be in coma, walked out of the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) on his own and exposed an alleged medical fraud done by the private hospital where he was admitted.\nThe man has claimed that he was being held captive in the hospital while his family was forced to pay Rs one lakh for his treatment, which now appears to be \"unnecessary\".\nAccording to a report by the Free Press Journal, Banti Ninama, a resident of Deendayal Nagar, was admitted to the hospital after sustaining injuries in a fight. His family was told by the doctors that he had slipped into a coma and that he required immediate medical attention and expensive treatment.\nFearing for his life, Ninama's wife and mother somehow started arranging the money, borrowing from friends and relatives. However, what happened next shocked everyone! In a viral video, now being widely circulated online, Ninama casually walked out the hospital with no signs of the severe condition he was being kept in the hospital for.\nHe alleged that he was forcibly held captive by five doctors, while they pressurised his family for the large amount of money. Despite this, he managed to escape their custody, later exposing them over their reported scam.\n\nA post shared by Jist (@jist.news)\nLater, his wife confirmed the incident and said, \"They told us he had a spinal fracture and had fallen into a coma. They handed us prescriptions, and we bought everything they asked for. Then, they told us to pay Rs 1 lakh for the treatment. We had to beg our relatives for money. We ran from one place to another and finally managed to gather the amount\".\nThe incident has sparked concerns over irrationally expensive treatment costs charged by private hospitals, with netizens demanding stricter regulations to curb such unfair practices.\n\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "WORLD\nThe report, which cited four people with firsthand knowledge of their content, on the condition of anonymity, also noted that Trump, in an early February call, challenged the border treaty between the two countries and told Trudeau he didn't like their shared water agreements.\nSagar Malik\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 08:58 AM IST\nAmid the ongoing tariff war between the two countries, US President Donald Trump, during his conversation with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, raised the point that he did not believe in the border demarcation treaty between them and wants to revise the boundary, the New York Times reported.\nThe report, which cited four people with firsthand knowledge of their content, on the condition of anonymity, also noted that Trump, in an early February call, challenged the border treaty between the two countries and told Trudeau he didn't like their shared water agreements.\nRecently, Justin Trudeau made an extraordinary statement that was largely lost in the fray of the moment, as per NYT.\r\n\t\"The excuse that he's giving for these tariffs today of fentanyl is completely bogus, completely unjustified, completely false,\" Trudeau told the news media in Ottawa.\n\"What he wants is to see a total collapse of the Canadian economy, because that'll make it easier to annex us,\" he added.\r\n\tThe conversation between Washington and Ottawa on February 3 not only included discussions on staving off tariffs on Canadian exports but Trump also laid out a long list of grievances he had with the trade relationship between the two countries, including Canada's protected dairy sector, the difficulty American banks face in doing business in Canada and Canadian consumption taxes that Trump deems unfair because they make American goods more expensive.\nNotably, the border treaty that Trump referred to was established in 1908 and finalized the international boundary between Canada, then a British dominion, and the United States, as reported by NYT.\nTrump also mentioned revisiting the sharing of lakes and rivers between the two nations, which is regulated by a number of treaties, a topic he's expressed interest in in the past.\nThe report further cited Trump's response to the media on January 7, wherein, he had said that he is planning to use \"economic force\" against Canada.\nThe persistent social media references to Canada as the \"51st state\" and Trudeau as its \"Governor\" had begun to grate both inside the Canadian government and more broadly, as reported by NYT.\nFollowing the talks between the two leaders, Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick in a conversation with Canada's finance minister, Dominic LeBlanc, issued a devastating message, according to several people familiar with the call that Trump, he said, had come to realize that the relationship between the United States and Canada was governed by a slew of agreements and treaties that were 'easy to abandon.'\nHe also wanted to eject Canada out of an intelligence-sharing group known as the 'Five Eyes' that also includes Britain, Australia and New Zealand, according to NYT.\nHe wanted to tear up the Great Lakes agreements and conventions between the two nations that lay out how they share and manage Lakes Superior, Huron, Erie and Ontario, the report further added.\nIt also noted that he is also reviewing military cooperation between the two countries, particularly the North American Aerospace Defence Command.\nA sigh of relief, however, has been that the Secretary of State Marco Rubio, has refrained from delivering threats, and recently dismissed the idea that the United States was looking at scrapping military cooperation.\nHowever, Canada's politicians across the spectrum, and Canadian society at large, are frayed and deeply concerned. Officials do not see the Trump administration's threats as empty; they see a new normal when it comes to the United States, the report added.\n\r\n\t(This story has not been edited by DNA staff and is published from ANI).\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "Months after Ratan Tata's death, Tata Sons Chairman N Chandrasekaran shares heartfelt memory: 'In last few years...'",
        "BUSINESS\nRatan Tata, who passed away last year at the age of 86, led the Tata Group for over two decades\nShivam Verma\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 01:08 PM IST\nTata Sons' chairman N Chandrasekaran recently shared a heartfelt memory of Ratan Tata at an event. According to The Economic Times, he recalled how, despite his declining health in recent years, Tata always made it a point to personally receive him and see him off. \"I told him, \u2018Sir, you don\u2019t have to do this,\u2019 but he insisted. Courtesy and fairness were deeply important to him,\" Chandrasekaran said.\nRatan Tata, who passed away last year at the age of 86, led the Tata Group for over two decades, spearheading its global expansion. Under his leadership, the company acquired Tetley Tea (2000), Corus Steel (2007), and Jaguar-Land Rover (2008), marking India\u2019s entry into major international markets. He was also the driving force behind the Indica, India\u2019s first homegrown car, and the affordable Nano car project.\nA graduate in architecture from Cornell University, Tata joined the family business in 1962 and took over as chairman in 1991. He introduced key reforms, promoting younger leaders and modernizing the group's operations.\nRatan Tata was known for his modest lifestyle and commitment to philanthropy, with two-thirds of Tata Sons\u2019 shares held by charitable trusts. After stepping down, he became an active startup investor, backing companies like Paytm, Ola Electric, and Urban Company.\nIn recognition of his immense contributions, he was awarded the Padma Vibhushan, India\u2019s second-highest civilian honor, in 2008.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "Syria revenge killings: Over 1000 dead in 2 days of violence as security forces clash with Assad loyalists, here's all you need to know",
        "WORLD\nThe clashes began between government forces and supporters of former President Bashar Assad and later escalated into revenge killings\nShivam Verma\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 02:07 PM IST\nSyria has witnessed one of its deadliest incidents in recent years, with more than 1,000 people killed in just two days of violence. According to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the clashes began between government forces and supporters of former President Bashar Assad and later escalated into revenge killings.\nDeadly clashes and retaliation\nThe violence has claimed the lives of at least 745 civilians, including many who were killed at close range. Additionally, 125 government security personnel and 148 militants linked to Assad lost their lives. Large parts of Latakia province have been left without electricity and drinking water as a result of the fighting.\nThe conflict started on Thursday when security forces tried to arrest a wanted individual near Jableh. However, they were ambushed by Assad loyalists, leading to intense clashes, as reported by the Associated Press (AP).\nTargeting of Alawites\nOn Friday, the violence took a dangerous turn when Sunni Muslim gunmen, who support the government, began targeting Alawites, the minority sect to which Assad belongs. The attacks have created a significant challenge for Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the group that played a key role in removing Assad from power.\nResidents described horrifying scenes of brutality in Alawite villages. Ali Sheha, a 57-year-old from Baniyas, told AP, \u201cBodies were on the streets. The gunmen were less than 100 meters away, firing at homes and residents.\u201d He added that the attackers checked people\u2019s IDs to confirm their sect before killing them.\nInternational reactions\nThe Syrian government has claimed that it has regained control over most of the areas captured by Assad loyalists. Meanwhile, France has strongly condemned the violence. A statement from the French foreign ministry said, \u201cParis condemns in the strongest possible terms atrocities committed against civilians on religious grounds.\u201d\nThousands of Alawites have fled their homes, with many seeking shelter at Russia\u2019s Hmeimim airbase. Lebanese legislator Haidar Nasser urged the international community to protect Alawites, stating, \u201cThe international community should protect Alawites, who are Syrian citizens loyal to their country.\u201d\nAs tensions remain high, the situation in Syria continues to be fragile, with fears of further violence and instability.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "HMPV Cases In India: Why is HMPV impacting children?",
        "INDIA\nHMPV significantly affects children due to its link with severe respiratory illnesses, particularly among young and vulnerable populations. It is a leading cause of acute respiratory infections, accounting for approximately 10 per cent to 12 per cent of such illnesses in children.\nSrishty Choudhury\nUpdated : Jan 06, 2025, 04:15 PM IST\nA new case of Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) has been reported in Gujarat, bringing the total number of cases in India to three. The latest infection involves a two-year-old child from Rajasthan who was admitted to a private hospital in Ahmedabad's Chandkheda after exhibiting symptoms of cold and cough. The child is currently stable, according to civic officials.\n\r\n\tThis report follows the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare's announcement earlier on Monday regarding two confirmed HMPV cases involving infants in Bengaluru. A three-month-old girl and an eight-month-old boy were diagnosed with HMPV during routine surveillance; both had a history of bronchopneumonia, which is a serious lung infection affecting the alveoli and bronchi.\n\nWhy is HMPV Impacting Children?\n\r\n\tHMPV significantly affects children due to its link with severe respiratory illnesses, particularly among young and vulnerable populations. It is a leading cause of acute respiratory infections, accounting for approximately 10 per cent to 12 per cent of such illnesses in children. While most cases are mild, around 5\u00a0per cent to 16 per cent of affected children may develop serious conditions like pneumonia or bronchiolitis, which often require hospitalisation.\n\r\n\tThe heightened risk for children, especially infants and toddlers, stems from their lack of pre-existing immunity to HMPV. The initial infection usually results in more severe symptoms, while subsequent infections tend to be milder as some immunity develops. The most severe cases typically occur in children aged 6 to 12 months.\n\r\n\tChildren with underlying health issues, such as asthma or those born prematurely, face an increased risk of severe complications from HMPV infections. Research indicates that HMPV can worsen asthma symptoms, leading to hospitalizations and the need for respiratory support.\n\r\n\tHMPV spreads easily through respiratory droplets and can also be transmitted via contact with contaminated surfaces. This high contagion rate contributes to its rapid spread among children, particularly in communal settings like daycare centers.\n\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "US millionaire Bryan Johnson launches \u2018Don\u2019t Die\u2019: A new \u2018Religion\u2019 for longevity",
        "VIRAL\nUS millionaire Bryan Johnson launched the \"Don't Die\" movement, aiming to create a new religion focused on longevity and merging humanity with AI.\nPravrajya Suruchi\nUpdated : Mar 08, 2025, 05:15 PM IST\nUS millionaire Bryan Johnson recently announced his ambitious plans to \"save humankind\" and launch a new religion called \"Don\u2019t Die\" amid the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). Through a detailed thread on X (formerly Twitter), Johnson introduced his new app and urged people to join the movement to become those who will be \u201cadmired and respected\u201d by the 25th century.\nWhat is 'Don\u2019t Die'?\r\n\tJohnson explained that \"Don\u2019t Die\" is not just an ideology but a framework for transitioning into the era of AI while focusing on longevity and wellness. He stated, \"Don\u2019t Die becomes history's fastest-growing ideology. It saves the human race and ushers in an existence more spectacular than we can imagine. It is inevitable. The only question is: will you be an early or late adopter?\"\nOn a personal level, Johnson shared that he has been living by the \"Don\u2019t Die\" principles for years. This includes maintaining a healthy lifestyle by eating well, exercising regularly, and managing stress. He also focuses on improving his body's health through scientific measurement and protocols. Johnson claims that these practices have given him \"the slowest aging speed in recorded history.\"\nWhy Now?\r\n\tJohnson revealed that his inspiration came from a thought experiment where he imagined himself interacting with people from the 25th century. He believed they would view \"Don\u2019t Die\" as the key to how humanity saved itself and merged with AI. To turn this idea into a global movement, he invited people to become \"Don\u2019t Die Citizens\" by downloading the app, tracking their \"Don\u2019t Die Score,\" connecting with others, and starting local communities.\nMixed Reactions on Social Media\r\n\tJohnson\u2019s post received mixed reactions. Some expressed enthusiasm, with one user saying they would organize meetups and activities for \"Don\u2019t Die\" in Michigan. Others were skeptical, questioning whether the new \"religion\" would cost money or if it was better described as a movement rather than a religion.\nOne user commented, \u201cIt\u2019s a mistake to call it a religion as most people already have one and don\u2019t believe in having two. Better to call it a movement, ideology, something else that isn\u2019t generally considered mutually exclusive.\u201d Another joked, \u201cMy knee literally won\u2019t stop jerking,\u201d referring to Johnson's request to hold back a knee-jerk reaction.\nBryan Johnson's Journey\r\n\tBryan Johnson, founder and CEO of Kernel Holding SA, gained global attention after Bloomberg published an article titled \u201cHow to Be 18 Years Old Again for Only $2 Million a Year.\u201d Since then, he has been openly documenting his journey to reverse aging, often stating his ultimate goal: to not die.\nJohnson's vision for \"Don\u2019t Die\" is to merge scientific wellness practices with AI-driven advancements, offering a pathway to a healthier, longer life and possibly the future of humanity. Whether this idea will gain widespread acceptance or remain a niche movement is yet to be seen.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "Maharashtra reports 225 cases of Guillain-Barre Syndrome, 12 deaths",
        "INDIA\nOf the reported cases, 179 patients have recovered and been discharged. However, 24 individuals remain in intensive care, with 15 requiring ventilator support.\nSonali Sharma\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 06:16 AM IST\nMaharashtra has reported 225 cases of Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), with 197 confirmed and 28 under suspicion. The outbreak has led to 12 fatalities, including six confirmed deaths and six suspected cases, according to state health authorities.\nOf the reported cases, 179 patients have recovered and been discharged. However, 24 individuals remain in intensive care, with 15 requiring ventilator support. The cases are spread across multiple regions, including Pune Municipal Corporation, recently added villages, Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation, Pune Rural, and other districts.\nHealth officials are closely monitoring the situation and have urged medical facilities to remain vigilant. The Guillain-Barre Syndrome is a rare neurological disorder that can cause muscle weakness and paralysis, often triggered by infections. While most patients recover with timely medical intervention, severe cases may require prolonged hospitalisation and ventilatory support.\nThe state government has intensified surveillance efforts and is coordinating with hospitals to ensure adequate treatment and resources for affected patients. Public health advisories have been issued to raise awareness about early symptoms and the importance of seeking immediate medical attention. In response to the rising cases of Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) in Maharashtra, the Public Health Department has implemented several measures to contain the outbreak and prevent further spread.\nA state-level rapid response team was immediately dispatched to the affected areas to assess the situation and coordinate mitigation efforts.Authorities in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and Pune Rural have been directed to strengthen surveillance activities.As part of the ongoing investigation, 7,262 water samples from different parts of the city have been sent to the Public Health Laboratory for chemical and biological analysis.\nSo far, contamination has been detected in 144 water sources, prompting necessary corrective actions. Additionally, intensified health promotion activities have been initiated to raise public awareness.\nThe government has also appealed to private medical practitioners to report any suspected GBS cases to the respective public health authorities for timely intervention. To enhance monitoring, house-to-house surveillance has been carried out across multiple regions, covering 89,699 households--46,534 in the Pune Municipal Corporation, 29,209 in the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC), and 13,956 in the Pune Rural.\nMeanwhile, 82 serum samples have been sent to the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS) in Bengaluru for Antiganglioside antibody testing, which is crucial for diagnosing and understanding the outbreak's underlying causes. The state health department has assured the public that it is fully prepared to implement preventive and control measures and urged citizens not to panic.\nAuthorities are continuing to monitor the situation closely while coordinating with hospitals to ensure adequate medical care for affected patients. In light of the ongoing Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) outbreak in Maharashtra, the state's Public Health Department has issued guidelines urging citizens to take preventive measures and maintain hygiene to reduce the risk of infection.\nAuthorities have advised residents to ensure water quality by drinking only boiled water and consuming fresh, clean food. To minimize health risks, the public has been warned against eating stale or partially cooked food, particularly chicken and mutton.\nThe health department has reassured citizens that the situation is under control and has urged people not to panic. Anyone experiencing symptoms suggestive of GBS is encouraged to seek medical attention at government hospitals without delay.\nOfficials have also requested that citizens refrain from sending water samples for independent testing. Instead, individuals seeking water quality assessments or information related to GBS should contact the Pune Municipal Corporation's designated helplines. The state government continues to monitor the situation closely, reinforcing surveillance and medical response measures to contain the outbreak and ensure public safety.\n(This story has not been edited by DNA staff and is published from ANI)\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

The officer had said that while Holi is celebrated once a year, Friday prayers happen every week. He suggested that those uncomfortable with Holi colours should stay indoors.\nSpeaking at the India Today Conclave, Adityanath said the officer, though speaking in a straightforward manner, was correct. He thanked religious leaders for deciding to hold Friday prayers after 2 PM this year, as Holi falls on the same day. He also said that those who wish to pray earlier can do so at home.\nSambhal, which saw communal violence last year, has been in focus after the police officer\u2019s remark. The opposition Samajwadi Party has criticised the officer, calling him biased toward the ruling BJP.\nAt the event, Adityanath also addressed the recent Maha Kumbh stampede, where 30 pilgrims died on January 29. He denied claims that the government tried to hide the number of deaths. He said the administration\u2019s first priority was helping the injured and managing the large crowd. Once the situation was under control, the media was informed.\nThe Chief Minister also called the Maha Kumbh a symbol of unity and a lesson for those who questioned its significance.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

A section of social media users recently accused the Korean singer of plagiarism after her song Like Jennie sounded similar to that of Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani's title anthem, Rani's Intro Theme, which introduced Alia Bhatt's character Rani, in the movie.\nPritam, who composed the music for the 2023 film also starring Ranveer Singh, shared a lengthy note on his Instagram handle on Friday and said that some similarities tend to happen in music. He noted that even the name of the artist and Bhatt's character in the film sound similar. \"Rani and Jennie are names that rhyme, so a similar flow in one phrase doesn\u2019t make it a copy. In music, minor similarities are bound to happen\u2014whether through rhymes, phrasing, or even within the same genre,\" he wrote.\nHe further added, \"Instead of focusing on tiny details, it\u2019s important to see the bigger picture. In today\u2019s interconnected world, where artists share the same platforms, no one is deliberately trying to copy someone else\u2019s work. Creating a song takes immense effort, and if an artist truly resonates with an idea, they can simply collaborate.\"\nThe 53-year-old composer, whose credits include blockbuster songs such as Kesariya, Tum Se Hi, Badtameez Dil, Tu Hi Meri Shab Hai, and Channa Mereya among others, also said that coincidences tend to happen in creative process. \"Music is about creativity, unique artistic perspective, influence, and sometimes pure coincidence - especially when arists exit on the same creative wavelength. Rather than tearing artist down, celebrating their work makes far more sense. Wishing Jennie all the best for her new album\", he concluded. Like Jennie is a track from Jennie's latest album Ruby, that comprises 15 songs in total.\nA post shared by Pritam (@ipritamofficial)\nPritam's soundtrack for Rocky Aur Ranii Ki Prem Kahaani was highly appreciated with songs such as Tum Kya Mile, Dhindhora Baaje Re, Ve Kamleya, and What Jhumka becoming chartbusters.

Adding to the mystery, the cast members had not tagged her in their posts, amidst her ongoing legal issues.\nVarsha Agarwal\nUpdated : Mar 08, 2025, 05:25 PM IST\nThe recently-released Nadaaniyan features Ibrahim Ali Khan and Khushi Kapoor in lead roles, alongside an ensemble cast including Mahima Chaudhary, Suniel Shetty, Dia Mirza, and Jugal Hansraj. The film also includes influencer Apoorva Makhija, who is currently embroiled in a controversy surrounding India's Got Latent show. Interestingly, the cast members have not tagged Apoorva in their social media posts, sparking speculation about whether this was a deliberate snub or a decision made by her team.\nWas Apoorva Makhija deliberately snubbed from Nadaaniyan?\nApoorva's absence from the film's premiere and her silence on social media about her role in the movie had sparked curiosity. Adding to the mystery, the cast members had not tagged her in their posts, amidst her ongoing legal issues. Her co-star Agasthya Shah shared behind-the-scenes photos from the film's set on Instagram, tagging Ibrahim Ali Khan, Khushi Kapoor, and others. Notably, one of the images featured Apoorva, but she was conspicuously left out of the tags. Even other cast members including Neel, Aaliyah, and Dev, shared a group photo from the film's set, but none of them tagged Apoorva.\nFans spotted her in the image and began questioning why she wasn't tagged.Comments flooded in, with some expressing delight at seeing her, such as \"Finally saw Apoorva after a long time\". Others wondered why she wasn't tagged, with comments like \"Oh, she didn\u2019t tag the Rebel kid\", \"Why isn\u2019t Apoorva tagged?\", \"Rebel absence is just not so done\", and \"Why is no one tagging Rebel Kid?\". However, the mystery was solved when a fan revealed that Apoorva had turned off Instagram's tagging feature, preventing anyone from tagging her in posts. This move is likely an attempt to avoid unwanted negativity and harassment on social media amid her ongoing controversy.\n\nApoorva Makhija's controversy\nApoorva is currently embroiled in controversy surrounding Ranveer Allahbadia's comments on Samay Raina's show, India's Got Latent. The National Commission for Women (NCW) has summoned Apoorva, Ranveer, Samay Raina, Ashish Chanchlani, and others in connection with the issue. The controversy began when Allahbadia made offensive remarks about parental sex on the show, sparking widespread outrage and multiple complaints against him.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

This match also marks the conclusion of their home leg in Lucknow, and they are eager to end their disappointing campaign on a positive note. Unfortunately, the Warriorz were knocked out of the playoffs race after the results from Friday night, with the Gujarat Giants securing eight points. This situation has also placed the Royal Challengers Bengaluru in a must-win scenario following a string of losses during their home leg.\nThe Indian players, especially in batting, have faced challenges for the Warriorz, with Grace Harris, Georgia Voll, Chinelle Henry, and Sophie Ecclestone all needing to elevate their game. While Uma Chetry, Vrinda Dinesh, and Kiran Navgire have shown potential, their performances haven't been sufficient to back up the overseas stars. Even captain Deepti Sharma has struggled to make a significant impact.\nOn the flip side, RCB is counting on captain Smriti Mandhana to guide the team to victory. The team's reliance on Ellyse Perry has revealed vulnerabilities in the lineup, particularly with some key players absent. Sneh Rana and Kim Garth, stepping in as replacements, have done well, but RCB needs their top players to rise to the occasion. RCB must secure wins in two consecutive matches to compete with the Giants and the Mumbai Indians for a playoff spot.

The subsequent games saw a decrease in total scores, with UP scoring 150 and Gujarat chasing a total of 177 in the following match. Lucknow has hosted three games, with the 150-run mark being surpassed in five out of six innings. Spinners have been more successful than fast bowlers, with a better average and economy rate compared to seamers.\nWeather report\nThe weather at Ekana Stadium will be warm with hazy sunshine, temperatures around 32 degrees, and a RealFeel of 33 degrees.

Meanwhile, reciprocal tariffs, expected to bring a significant shift in the US trade policies, is set to come in effect from April 2.\nThe US President also slammed countries like Canada for imposing 250 per cent tariffs on American dairy products, calling it \"unfair\".\n\"Canada has been ripping us off for years on tariffs for lumber and for dairy products. Two hundred and fifty percent. Nobody ever talks about that. Two hundred and fifty percent tariff, which is taking advantage of our farmers. So that's not going to happen anymore. We're going to be -- they'll be met with the exact same tariff unless they drop it,\" Trump said.\nNotably, the introduction of reciprocal tariffs is expected to have massive implications on the global trade relations, given other countries will have to reconsider their tariff policies.\nWith inputs from ANI.\n\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

Among her many prized jewels, one gemstone holds a special place in her heart \u2014 the emerald. But for Nita Ambani, this dazzling green gem is more than just an accessory; it is believed to bring good luck, prosperity, and positivity.\nIn astrology, emerald, known as \u2018panna\u2019 in Hindi, is associated with financial stability, health benefits, and good fortune. Many believe that wearing an emerald can attract wealth and success, making it a powerful symbol of abundance. It is also linked to Goddess Lakshmi, the deity of prosperity, further enhancing its spiritual significance.\nEmeralds have been valued throughout history, particularly in Indian culture. Ancient rulers and Mughal emperors admired their rich green color and mystical properties. In Western traditions, emeralds are connected to Venus, the Roman goddess of love and beauty, symbolizing nature, fertility, and eternal youth.\nBeyond its cultural and spiritual significance, emeralds are also believed to have health benefits. Some say the gemstone can help reduce eye problems and bring emotional balance. It is also thought to drive away negativity, replacing it with peace and positivity.\nMany people admire Nita Ambani\u2019s success and see her love for emeralds as a reflection of her belief in their positive energy. For her, the emerald is not just a beautiful gemstone but a symbol of faith, prosperity, and well-being.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "CRICKET\nVirat Kohli got injured before the 2025 Champions Trophy final against New Zealand. He has been India's top performer in the tournament, scoring the most runs for the team.\nChankesh Rao\nUpdated : Mar 08, 2025, 09:20 PM IST\nIndia encountered a worrying injury scare ahead of the 2025 Champions Trophy final, as reports emerged that Virat Kohli had taken a hit to his knee. Kohli had already missed an ODI against England due to a knee problem, raising concerns among Indian fans who are eager for the Men in Blue to clinch the title after a 12-year wait.\nAs reported by Geotv, Kohli injured himself while facing a fast bowler during a practice session. He stopped batting and did not return to the nets after the incident, but thankfully, the right-handed batsman is fit to play in the final.\nKohli has been a key player for India throughout the tournament, scoring a match-winning century against Pakistan and an unbeaten 100. His vital 84 in the semi-final against Australia helped India reach the final, where his performance will be crucial. With 217 runs in 4 matches, Kohli's form is essential for India's chances of success.\nCurrently, India has no other injury concerns, and all players are available for selection. The team might consider replacing Kuldeep Yadav with Harshit Rana for the final.\nIn contrast, New Zealand is dealing with an injury issue, as Matt Henry's availability for the final is uncertain due to a shoulder injury he sustained against South Africa. Head coach Gary Stead remains hopeful that Henry will recover in time for the match.\nThe final of the ICC event is set for Sunday, March 9, with the match starting at 2:30 PM IST and the toss at 2:00 PM IST. Both India and New Zealand have previously secured wins against each other in the Champions Trophy, promising an exciting and competitive final showdown.\nAlso read| Uorfi Javed says Dhanashree Verma reached out to her amid divorce rumours with Yuzvendra Chahal: 'She was going through...\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

This is the third consecutive time the Indian side has reached to the finals of the Champions Trophy.\nAseem Sharma\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 02:55 PM IST\nIndia vs New Zealand Live Cricket Score: Rohit Sharma-led Men in Blue are set to lock horns against Mitchell Santner's Blackcaps in the Final match of the ICC Champions Trophy 2025. After clinching a semi-final game against the World Champions Australia, Team India became the first team to reach the finals. On the other hand, the Kiwis defeated the South African side to make it to the finals. Both the teams faced each other in the tournament in the league stage and the game was won by Team India convincingly. Interestingly, India has reached the finals of the Champions Trophy for the third consecutive time, lifting the trophy in 2013 and losing the final match against Pakistan in 2017. So, stay tuned to this space for all the latest and live updates about the IND vs NZ game.\nAfter winning the crucial toss, New Zealand openers Will Young and Rachin Ravindra have provided a good start to their team. After 5 overs, NZ 37/0.\nWill Young hits the first boundary of the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 Final. After 1 over, NZ 4/0 with Young and Rachin out in the middle.\n\n\nNew Zealand (Playing XI) - Will Young, Rachin Ravindra, Kane Williamson, Daryl Mitchell, Tom Latham (WK), Glenn Phillips, Michael Bracewell, Mitchell Santner (C), Nathan Smith (In for Matt Henry), Kyle Jamieson, Will O Rourke.\nIndia (Unchanged Playing XI) - Rohit Sharma (C), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, Axar Patel, KL Rahul (WK), Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, Mohammad Shami, Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakaravarthy.\n\nBad luck for the Indian skipper in the toss continues as he lost his 12th straight one today. New Zealand skipper Mitchell Santner elected to bat first against the Men in Blue in the Final of ICC Champions Trophy 2025.\n\n\nIndia's star player Virat Kohli suffered a minor knee injury one day ahead of the Champions Trophy 2025 Final match. Fans are worried about Kohli's fitness for an important game like today's and this question will be answered when skipper Rohit Sharma arrives for the toss.\nOn the other hand, New Zealand's star pacer Matt Henry, who has taken important wickets in the tournament so far, suffered a shoulder injury while fielding in the semi-final match against South Africa.\n\nThe Indian skipper, who might be leading the team in winning matches in ICC events, has been facing tough luck in the toss. He has lost 11 consecutive toss in a row. So, will Rohit be able to put an end to this unique streak in today's game?\n\nA post shared by ICC (@icc)\nSeveral reports recently claimed that skipper Rohit Sharma might take retirement from the 50-over format just like he did after clinching the T20 World Cup. Speaking on the ongoing rumours, former skipper Sourav Ganguly said, ''Why is there talk of Rohit Sharma's retirement? Why is this even a question? He won the World Cup just a few months ago. I don't know what the selectors are thinking, Rohit is playing very well.''\n''India is far better than New Zealand. India played in the 2023 World Cup finals, won the 2024 T20 World Cup, and they are still unbeaten in this Champions Trophy. The same team will play,'' India Today reported quoting Sourav.\n\nTotal Matches Played - 119\nIndia - 61\nNew Zealand - 50\nTied - 1\nNo Result - 7\n\nThe Final of the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 between India and New Zealand can be viewed on Star Sports network and Jio Hotstar for live streaming on OTT.\nIndia and New Zealand have faced each other five times in the knockout stages of ICC tournaments wherein the Blackcaps have come out on top three times while the Men in Blue tasted success twice. Interestingly, India beat New Zealand in the 2000 edition of the Champions Trophy (then ICC KnockOut Trophy) in the quarterfinals but lost the game in the Final match by 4 wickets.\nBoth India and New Zealand have lifted the Champions Trophy in the past. While the Blackcaps clinched the inaugural tournament (then ICC KnockOut Trophy), Team India won the Champions Trophy in 2013 and shared the title with Sri Lanka in 2002.\nA post shared by ICC (@icc)\nTeam India's vice-captain Shubman Gill has given an update on whether skipper Rohit Sharma is retiring or not from the 50-over format after the completion of the ongoing ICC event. Speaking at the pre-match conference, Gill said, ''No discussion in the dressing room or with me, even Rohit bhai would be thinking about the Champions Trophy final lime all of us. So, nothing like that now.''\n''I think once the match ends tomorrow, he will make a decision. There is no talk about it within the setup,'' he added.\n\nThe New Zealand captain is confident of his team's ability ahead of the Champions Trophy Final. ''It's easy to say it's just another game, it's obviously not, but I think the way you approach it has to be the same. We've done a lot of good stuff this tournament, we're just trying to progress and build on the things we've been doing as a team.''\nThe New Zealand captain is confident of his team's ability ahead of the #ChampionsTrophy Final\n\r\n\t\tMore from Mitchell Santner https://t.co/1nUEF7mnrc pic.twitter.com/vgoTyITBFz\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "BOLLYWOOD\nSharing how her parents reacted to her decision to marry Aamir Khan, Kiran Rao stated, \"It was a shocker for them. They were taken aback and they were worried that I might be overshadowed by Aamir's larger-than-life persona.\"\nAman Wadhwa\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 02:41 PM IST | Edited by : Aman Wadhwa\nIn a candid conversation about her marriage, creative journey, and personal evolution, Kiran Rao, the former wife of Bollywood superstar Aamir Khan, shared some invaluable insights into her life as a South Indian middle-class woman married to one of India's most famous actors. Her honest reflections on their relationship, their creative collaborations, and the dynamics of their family are as inspiring as they are thought-provoking.\nWhen asked about her parents' reaction to her decision to marry Aamir Khan, Kiran was refreshingly honest. \"It was a shocker for them,\" she admitted in an interview with ANI. \"They were taken aback. In their eyes, I had a lot of promise. I was someone who wanted to do a lot of things, and they were worried that I might be overshadowed by Aamir's larger-than-life persona,\" she added.\nIndeed, Aamir Khan's fame can be overwhelming, and Kiran with her independent spirit, felt the pressure. But what she found most comforting was Aamir's acceptance of her as her own person. \"Aamir has never expected me to be a certain way. He has always been happy for me to be myself, and that's one of the greatest things about him,\" Kiran shared.\nReflecting on the recent wedding of Aamir's daughter, Ira Khan, to Nupur Shikhare, Kiran shared beautiful insights about their blended family. Kiran, who has always been incredibly close to Aamir's children from his first marriage, sees their bond as an organic result of the kindness and warmth Aamir fosters in his family. \"His family is incredibly warm. So it happens quite organically,\" she said. \"His friends, who've known him since childhood, have become family. Once introduced to the family, those relationships continue to stay strong, even as individuals,\" she explained.\nFor Kiran, the key to their family dynamic has been acceptance and unconditional support. \"The family accepts you as a person, not just in a role,\" she added, emphasizing that both her and Aamir's children--his son Junaid and daughter Ira--have grown up with a sense of inclusion and love. It's a family that extends beyond blood ties, with even Nupur Shikhare, Ira's husband, becoming part of the larger family fabric.\nBut Kiran's journey has not always been easy. The initial challenge of being in the shadow of Aamir Khan's fame was real. The weight of public expectation, combined with the pressure to maintain her identity, was a constant struggle as she said, \"When you marry someone incredibly famous, you do lose a part of your own identity,\" Kiran confessed, adding, \"It took me a long time to find my own voice again.\"\nFor Kiran, regaining her sense of self wasn't just about public recognition but also about personal fulfillment. She admitted that it was only after some time that she could step out of Aamir's shadow and feel comfortable in her own identity. \"It wasn't just about reclaiming my public identity, but also about personal terms. Aamir allowed me to grow into my own person, to evolve, and it was because of him that I found the courage to say, 'I love you, I love this family, but I need to be on my own.'\"\nDespite their separation in 2021, Kiran and Aamir have maintained a respectful and supportive relationship, both personally and professionally. \"We have been able to work together creatively. It shows maturity on both our parts. It's not always easy - creative work can get heated - but that's what makes the collaboration so fulfilling,\" Kiran explained.\nKiran's own film production company, Kindling Pictures, has already made its mark, producing Laapataa Ladies. However, she continues to work with Aamir Khan Productions, underscoring their ongoing professional camaraderie. \"Aamir and I will always be there for each other,\" she concluded, reflecting on their ability to balance family, career, and creativity without acrimony.\nKiran Rao, Indian film producer and director, was married to Bollywood superstar Aamir Khan for over 15 years. The couple tied the knot in 2005 and had a son, Azad Rao Khan, in 2011. However, in July 2021, they announced their separation and decision to divorce, citing a desire to continue their individual journeys and co-parent their son. Despite their divorce, both Kiran and Aamir have maintained a cordial relationship and continue to support each other's professional endeavors.\nExcept for the headline, this story has not been edited by DNA staff and is published from ANI\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "WORLD\nThe massive deposit, located beneath the soil of Folswiller in the Moselle region, is estimated to hold 46 million tonnes of hydrogen\nShivam Verma\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 09:01 AM IST\nFrance has made a big discovery in green energy with the largest known natural hydrogen reserve on the planet. The massive deposit, located beneath the soil of Folswiller in the Moselle region, is estimated to hold 46 million tonnes of hydrogen. According to reports, the value of this reserve is around $92 trillion, with expectations that its worth will rise in the future.\nThis discovery, made by researchers from the Georesources Laboratory and CNRS, was unexpected.\nScientists were originally searching for methane but instead found an enormous supply of white hydrogen buried 1,250 meters underground. This form of hydrogen is a potential game-changer as it provides a clean energy source without carbon emissions.\nUnlike green hydrogen, which requires electricity from renewable sources for production, or grey hydrogen, which is derived from fossil fuels and contributes to pollution, white hydrogen is naturally occurring. It is found deep underground and does not require complex industrial processes or generate harmful emissions.\nCurrently, the world\u2019s hydrogen economy faces challenges due to high production costs and dependency on fossil fuels. White hydrogen presents a cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative. If similar reserves are found elsewhere, it could spark a global shift toward sustainable energy.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "HEALTH\nEven in your wildest dreams, have you ever thought that wearing a Saree and Petticoat may lead to skin cancer? Let's get to discover it further.\nMeemansa Shekhawat\nUpdated : Jan 31, 2025, 04:04 PM IST\nIn India, wearing Saree and Petticoat is deeply ingrained in our culture and fashion. While the origin of the trend dates back to ancient times, it is still a part of every Indian woman's wardrobe.\nBut, even in your wildest dreams, have you ever thought that wearing a Saree and Petticoat may lead to skin cancer? Yes, you heard that right. A research has shown that wearing tight petticoats teamed with sarees draped around the waist can put a lot of pressure on the abdomen, causing skin cancer.\nWhile wearing a Saree, many women tighten their petticoats (or underskirts), which can cause rashes, itching or other skin issues, ultimately generating the risk of cancer, doctors have observed.\nOver time, skin cancer may result from the tight petticoats increasing pressure on the waist and consistent rubbing on the skin.\nCauses of Saree and Petticoat cancer\nSome of the prominent causes of Saree and Petticoat cancer include continuous friction from the tight waist string, daily pressure on the abdomen from the pleats of Saree, sweat or moisture, absence of sunlight in such parts of the body.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of Saree and Petticoat cancer include - Darkening of the skin around the waist, red, itchy patches, formation of ulcers, and raised lumps around the waist.\nPreventive measures\nAs per a report by India Today, Dr Nataraj Naidu, Consultant Surgical Oncologist, SPARSH Hospital, Bangalore, suggest that women opt for looser, breathable fabric. They should ensure proper hygeine and follow regular skincare routines.\nMoreover, they should avoid wearing a saree on a regular basis and go for skin examination, in case, they develop unusual signs.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "Donald Trump's AI head Sriram Krishnan\u2019s views on H1B visas, green cards",
        "ANALYSIS\nInterestingly, Sriram Krishnan has spoken in favour of expanding the H1B program and expediting the green card for individuals belonging to certain professions. He has also been in favour of removing the country cap on H1-B visas and Green cards.\nTridivesh Singh Maini\nUpdated : Dec 26, 2024, 04:56 PM IST\nIncoming US President Donald Trump recently appointed Sriram Krishnan as his Senior Advisor on Artificial Intelligence. Chennai born techie Sriram Krishnan has vast experience and has been a general partner of the American venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz since 2021. He began his career with Microsoft, after which he joined Facebook. Till 2019, Sriram Krishnan worked for Twitter (now X) and closely worked with Elon Musk who will be co-heading DOGE (Department for Government efficiency)\nWhile announcing his appointment, Trump in a post on X said:\n\u201cSriram Krishnan will serve as Senior Policy Advisor for Artificial Intelligence at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy\u2026Sriram will focus on ensuring continued American leadership in A.I., and help shape and coordinate A.I. policy across Government, including working with the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology\u201d\nIn his post, Trump also mentioned Krishnan\u2019s rich experience and the fact that he began his career with Microsoft.\nInterestingly, Sriram Krishnan has spoken in favour of expanding the H1B program and expediting the green card for individuals belonging to certain professions. He has also been in favour of removing the country cap on H1-B visas and Green cards.\nSeveral Trump supporters were critical of his appointment pointing to his stance on H1B and Green cards. Far-right American activist Laura Loomer said that Sriram Krishnan\u2019s views on immigration are diametrically opposite to those of Trump and go against the \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda of Donald Trump. She also dubbed the Indian origin entrepreneur as a \u201ccareer leftist\u201d.\nDavid Sacks, Incoming White House A.I. & Crypto Czar\u00a0 and Elon Musk came to Sriram Krishan\u2019s defense.\nSacks highlighted the point that Sriram Krishnan does not want to remove all caps, but country-based ones. Said Sacks\n\u201cSriram still supports skills-based criteria for receiving a green card, not making the program unlimited. He wants to make the program entirely merit-based\u201d..\nElon Musk also said that the criticism of Sriram Krishnan lacked merit and was based on the \u2018fixed-pie\u2019 fallacy. Said Musk in a post on X:\n\u201cThe \u2018fixed pie\u2019 fallacy is at the heart of much wrong-headed economic thinking. There is essentially infinite potential for job and company creation. Think of all the things that didn\u2019t exist 20 or 30 years ago!\u201d\nThe appointment of Sriram Krishnan points to the possible divide within the upcoming Trump administration regarding immigration policies.\nIt is not just Sriram Krishnan, even Elon Musk himself has repeatedly highlighted the fact that the US should be open to welcoming talented individuals who contribute towards the country\u2019s economy.\nHere it would be pertinent to point out that Trump himself has spoken about the need for US to welcome and retain talent. During an interview, the incoming president had said that international students who graduate from US colleges should be granted Green cards. It remains to be seen if Trump actually implements this proposal.\nIn conclusion, it remains to be seen if Trump and his team go ahead with some of the tough policy reforms pertaining to immigration while also focusing on retaining international students with skills and qualifications. There could be divisions in the upcoming administration on the issue of immigration. Certain members of his team would not be opposed to an immigration policy which is merit-based, while others may favour an approach which is driven more by political interests and aimed at appealing to certain constituencies. While course-corrections in the realm of immigration policies are taking place across the Anglosphere \u2013 UK, Canada and Australia \u2013 some changes under Trump 2.0 can not be ruled out. At the same time an excessively insular immigration policy which discourages students and professionals would be counter productive for the US.\n(Disclaimer: The views expressed above are the author's own and do not reflect those of DNA.)\n\r\n\tThe author is a policy analyst and faculty member at the Jindal School of International Affairs, OP Jindal Global University, Sonipat.\n\n\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

An investigation is also launched to trace the origin of the email, which, prima facie, appears to have been sent from Russia. Meanwhile, Lieutenant Governor Vinai Kumar Saxena has spoken with the Police Commissioner, urging a comprehensive investigation into the recent bomb threats targeting schools across Delhi-NCR. The news comes just a day after prominent airports like Goa, Jaipur, and Mumbai received bomb threat emails. We will continue to bring more updates on the matter; keep watching DNA.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "World Cancer Day 2025: 5 simple lifestyle changes to reduce risk",
        "HEALTH\nHere are five steps to improve overall health and lower the likelihood of cancer.\nShweta Singh\nUpdated : Feb 03, 2025, 06:32 AM IST\nCancer remains one of the most life-threatening diseases globally, affecting millions of people each year. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), cancer was responsible for nearly 10 million deaths in 2020, making it one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. The disease can affect any part of the body and often progresses silently, making early detection and prevention crucial. While genetic factors play a role, lifestyle choices significantly impact cancer risk. As we observe World Cancer Day 2025, it is essential to raise awareness about the steps individuals can take to reduce their risk and lead healthier lives. Here are five steps to improve overall health and lower the likelihood of cancer.\n1. Maintain a Healthy Diet\nEating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can strengthen the immune system and reduce inflammation. Avoiding processed foods, excessive sugar, and red meat can also lower cancer risk.\n2. Stay Physically Active\nRegular exercise helps maintain a healthy weight, regulate hormones, and boost immunity. Engaging in at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity, such as walking, cycling, or yoga, can significantly reduce the risk of various cancers.\n3. Avoid Tobacco and Limit Alcohol\nSmoking is one of the leading causes of cancer, particularly lung, throat, and mouth cancers. Quitting tobacco and reducing alcohol consumption can drastically lower the chances of developing several types of cancer.\n4. Protect Yourself from the Sun\nSkin cancer is one of the most common types, but it is highly preventable. Using sunscreen, wearing protective clothing, and avoiding excessive sun exposure, especially during peak hours, can help reduce the risk of skin cancer.\n5. Schedule Regular Screenings and Check-ups\nEarly detection can make a significant difference in cancer treatment. Regular health check-ups and screenings, such as mammograms, pap smears, and colonoscopies, can help identify potential risks and ensure timely medical intervention.\nAlso read:\u00a0World Cancer Day 2025: Signs and symptoms of early-stage cervical cancer\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this article is for general informational purposes only.

        "French President Emmanuel Macron says Russia's aggression 'knows no borders'",
        "WORLD\nAs per Al Jazeera, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Macron's speech in which he called Russia a threat to France and Europe was \"extremely confrontational\".\nSrishty Choudhury\nUpdated : Mar 07, 2025, 04:23 PM IST\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday said Russian aggression \"knows no borders\" and is a direct threat to Europe as European Union leaders prepare to hold emergency talks in Brussels in the wake of the Trump administration's stance on transatlantic ties, Al Jazeera reported.\u00a0\"Who can believe that this Russia of today will stop at Ukraine?\" Macron said in a televised address late on Wednesday, as per Al Jazeera.\n\r\n\tIn a post on X, Macron said, \"Our generation will no longer receive the peace dividend. It is up to us to ensure that our children reap the dividends of our commitments tomorrow. So we will face it, together.\"\n\r\n\tMacron warned that Europe must be prepared to stand alone in the face of Russian aggression. \"I want to believe the US will stay by our side,\" said Macron. \"But we have to be ready if that isn't the case.\"\n\r\n\t\"The future of Europe does not have to be decided in Washington or Moscow,\" he added.\nMacron added that he plans next week to hold a meeting of army chiefs from European countries willing to send troops to Ukraine after any eventual peace deal with Russia, as per Al Jazeera.\nMacron also said he would discuss with his European partners extending French nuclear deterrence to other countries on the continent, but that the decision and control would continue to remain in the French president's hands.\n\"France will follow only one course: that of the will for peace and freedom, faithful to its history and its principles. The homeland needs you and your commitment,\" Macron said in a post on X.\nAs per Al Jazeera, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Macron's speech in which he called Russia a threat to France and Europe was \"extremely confrontational\".\nThe speech indicates that France is thinking about \"continuing the war\". Macron did not say anything about NATO's expansion towards Russia's borders, as per Kremlin.\n\r\n\t\"One can conclude that France thinks more about war, about continuing the war,\" said Peskov.\nThe conflict is a \"proxy war between nuclear powers\" - the US helping Ukraine and Russia - and it needs to come to an end, Al Jazeera quoted the Kremlin as saying.\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by DNA staff and is published from ANI)\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

One of the videos from the promotional interviews of the film has now resurfaced on social media, in which Urvashi is saying that she was the \"first\" to join the film, similar to her other \"first\" claims, and she is hilariously interrupted by Yami and Pulkit.\nTalking to Box Office India, Urvashi said, \"I was the first one to join the cast. That time the cast wasn\u2019t decided, who is going to play what.\" Yami interrupted and stated, \"That\u2019s what was told to everybody. We all were on board.\" Pulkit further jokingly added, \"Mujhse wo puch rahe the, Ye kaisi hai, ye kaisi hai (They were asking me. How is she? How is her as the heroine?).\nReacting to them, Urvashi added, \"So maybe she (Divya Khosla Kumar) kept it under wraps or whatever. So yeah, I signed that time. That\u2019s how it all started. A lot of people believe that I got it because of Love Dose, the song with Yo Yo Honey Singh, the international music video.\" Pulkit again interrupted and stated, \"You were so bad in that, Urvashi. How can you get it because of that?\". Urvashi stated, \"People do tell me that. I mean I signed this movie first. It somehow came later. That\u2019s how it happened. I have a very wonderful association with them. I did a song \u2018Daddy Mummy\u2019. I have 3 movie deal with them. This is the first film, and I am really excited about it. And Im also happy with the character which I am playing. It\u2019s a treat to work with her. She is an amazing director.\"\nA post shared by Bollywood ORRYginals (@thebollywoodorryginals)\nApart from Urvashi, Yami, and Pulkit, Sanam Re also featured Rishi Kapoor, Prachi Shah, Bharti Singh, and Manoj Joshi in key roles. Made in Rs 25 crore, Sanam Re earned Rs 27 crore net in India and grossed Rs 38 crore worldwide. The film was panned by the critics and audiences.

In her recent interview, the Gangubai Kathiawadi actress called Raha \"the new girlfriend in the family\" and also talked about the special connection that Ranbir shares with their daughter.\nTalking to YouTuber Jay Shetty on his podcast On Purpose, Alia shared how her life has changed after Raha's birth as she said, \"Now everything has changed because now I have a daughter, so now it's like there's a new girlfriend in the family. I become very childlike when I am with her. The one thing I am mindful about is to enjoy her childhood. I try to be present with Raha, which is something I don\u2019t do with other moments in my life. I am always 10 steps ahead otherwise, but with her, I try to be present and in the moment it happens more naturally because I want to enjoy every second.\"\nTalking about how she feels Ranbir has changed after Raha's birth, Alia added, \"When he looks at Raha, there are stars in his eyes. Of course, (that\u2019s true) for any parents. But when I see it, because I\u2019ve known Ranbir before and I know him now, I see the difference. I see the difference in the way he is with people, you know, as a father. He\u2019s just so sort of full. It\u2019s not like he was ever edgy. He always had a very calm demeanour, but there\u2019s a fullness which I experienced first-hand and that I see on a daily basis, and it\u2019s actually really sweet and special to watch their conversations. He\u2019s very creative when it comes to entertaining her. She entertains him as well, like they both have a very special friendship, I would say. Their bond is like they\u2019re two friends - either two adults or two toddlers, you know, different at different moments in life.\"\nMeanwhile, Alia Bhatt will next be seen in the action thriller Alpha. Slated to release on December 25 on Christmas, the upcoming film is the seventh installment in the YRF Spy Universe after Ek Tha Tiger, Tiger Zinda Hai, War, Pathaan, Tiger 3, and War 2.

While Chum ended as the fourth runner up, Karan went on to win the show. Even after Bigg Boss 18 ended in January, the two have taken forward their relationship forward and have been sharing their romantic photos on social media.\nThough Karan and Chum haven't officially confirmed their relationship status, they celebrated the Valentine's Day together in February. In a video shared by Chum from their dinner date, Karan even professed her love for her saying, \"Roses are red, Violets are blue, I don\u2019t care about anybody but I love you\", but they both laughed it off.\nNow, in his recent interview with Brut India, Karan was asked about his marriage plans with Chum and he replied, \"Now, I don't look nice while talking about marriage because people will get confused that I am getting married or cutting birthday cake every year. So, as Salman sir said the choice always lies with the girl.\"\nTalking about his relationship with Chum, he further added, \"With Chum and me right now, we are starting afresh. We are starting how we started in Bigg Boss, we are meeting, 'Hello, hi kaise ho?' because there are different tasks and different obstacles that we will go through in this Bigg Boss house (outside) which is abnormal. I call it abnormal, that (Bigg Boss) was normal. So, we are taking slow because she also has a past, I have a past. There are opinions here and there. There will be 100 messages and people saying something, so how do we cope with this is going to be our challenge right now.\"\nMeanwhile, Karan Veer Mehra has had two failed marriages.

        "CRICKET\nRayudu, a top-ranked Indian cricketer, was left off the 2019 World Cup squad in favor of Vijay Shankar. Despite injuries to Dhawan and Shankar during the tournament, Rayudu was still not selected.\nChankesh Rao\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 04:44 PM IST\nThe former Indian cricket player Ambati Rayudu has responded to Robin Uthappa's recent, widely shared remarks accusing Virat Kohli of being the reason Rayudu was left out of the 2019 ODI World Cup team.\u00a0 Rayudu made it clear that Kohli was the one who helped him get back into the Indian squad and supported him before the ICC event in England.\nRayudu, who was ranked as India's fourth-best player in the lead-up to the 2019 World Cup, showed his value with crucial performances.\u00a0 But in the end, he was left off of the World Cup squad because all-rounder Vijay Shankar was selected instead.\u00a0 When Shikhar Dhawan and Shankar both had injuries during the competition, Rayudu was once more overlooked.\nIn a recent interview with Lallontop, Uthappa claimed that then-captain Kohli showed favoritism, implying that a player could be dropped if Kohli disapproved of them. Uthappa suggested that Rayudu fell victim to this alleged bias.\n\"If he (Virat Kohli) didn't like anyone, he didn't feel someone was good, then they were cut. (Ambati) Rayudu is the prime example. You feel bad. Everybody has preferences, I agree, but you cannot close the door on a player after taking him to the cusp. He had World Cup clothes and a World Cup kit bag; everything was there at his home. A player would be thinking that he is going to the World Cup. But you shut the door on him. That wasn't fair according to me,\" Uthappa told Lallantop.\nIn a recent interview that garnered significant attention on social media, Rayudu acknowledged that Kohli, despite his strong preferences, supported him for the crucial No. 4 position leading up to the 2019 World Cup.\n\"What Uthappa was trying to say is that Kohli has strong likes and dislikes. But in my case, Kohli was the one who backed me. He liked me. When I was there at his captaincy, we played many games for India. He was the one who brought me into the team. He understands the struggle because he as well is from a humble background and has played tremendous cricket. It is never easy to excel as a batter coming from Delhi. To be a world-beater, especially in white-ball cricket, it's not easy. So he has seen everything,\" he said.\n\"His leadership sometimes was found wanting, which everyone knows. What Uthappa mentioned was that during his captaincy, he made mistakes. It's not about preferences, but it's about logic, which may be at that point in time was not the right thing to do. I won't say Kohli or Ravi Shastri or MSK (Prasad) did that, it was a collective decision. They thought something else would be better for their team. But I don't think it was personal,\" he added.\nAlso read| Meet Jasmin Walia, British singer rumoured to be dating cricketer Hardik Pandya, cheered for him in Dubai during Champions Trophy 2025\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "IND Vs NZ: What is the highest successful run-chase in Champions Trophy final?",
        "CRICKET\nNew Zealand chose to bat first and scored 252 runs in the Champions Trophy final against India in Dubai. India will need to chase down this target to win the match.\nChankesh Rao\nUpdated : Mar 09, 2025, 06:29 PM IST\nIn the 2025 Champions Trophy final at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Sunday (March 9), New Zealand won the toss and opted to bat first, setting a target of 252 runs for India. This total is the third-highest first-innings score in the tournament's history, making India's chase a formidable challenge.\nHistorically, the highest successful chase in a Champions Trophy final occurred when New Zealand chased down 265 to beat India by four wickets in the 2000 ICC KnockOut edition. South Africa's chase of 246 against the West Indies in the inaugural 1998 edition follows closely behind. Since the tournament was rebranded in 2002, no team has successfully chased a total over 250 runs to win the title.\nAside from the 2017 edition, where Pakistan posted 338/4 in their first innings against India, no team has crossed the 300-run mark in a Champions Trophy final. The matches in this tournament have typically featured lower scores, often impacted by rain interruptions that hinder high-scoring opportunities.\nIndia did well to limit New Zealand to 251/7 on the slow, turning pitch in Dubai, largely due to an impressive showing from their spinners. Varun Chakaravarthy took the first wicket of opener Will Young in the eighth over, followed by Kuldeep Yadav, who quickly dismissed Rachin Ravindra and Kane Williamson.\nRavindra Jadeja and Chakaravarthy continued the pressure by taking out Tom Latham and Glenn Phillips in the middle overs, while Daryl Mitchell steadied the innings with a solid 63 off 101 balls. Michael Bracewell and Glenn Phillips also made important contributions to help New Zealand reach a competitive score.\nAlso read| IND vs NZ Champions Trophy Final: Fifties from Daryl Mitchell, Michael Bracewell power New Zealand to 251/7 against India\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

While there's been a lot of focus on spin bowlers stepping up in the UAE, it was Matt Henry who starred with the ball for the Black Caps, claiming 5/42 off eight overs, in an innings where Shreyas Iyer top-scored for India with 79 off 98 balls.\nKane Williamson fought valiantly for the Kiwis with 81 (120 balls), but couldn't find support in the middle order.

        "VIRAL\nThis Shark Tank India's judge opens up about childhood bullying, being called \"moustache girl,\" and overcoming body image struggles.\nPravrajya Suruchi\nUpdated : Mar 08, 2025, 09:34 PM IST\nNamita Thapar, Executive Director of Emcure Pharmaceuticals and a popular judge on Shark Tank India, recently shared her painful experiences of being bullied as a child. Speaking at the India Today Conclave, she revealed how harsh judgments about her appearance impacted her deeply, expressing hope that societal attitudes will improve for future generations.\nNamita recalled being teased at school for her weight, acne, and facial hair. A particularly hurtful memory involved a boy mocking her as \"the girl with the moustache\" in Marathi, which left a lasting mark on her self-esteem. \"Those words stayed with me. It was tough growing up with constant criticism about my looks,\" she said.\nThis isn't the first time Namita has spoken about her struggles. In a podcast with author Chetan Bhagat, she shared that she battled emotional eating for 40 years. Food, especially sugary treats, became a source of comfort for her. \"When I felt hurt, I turned to food. It became a coping mechanism,\" she admitted.\nNamita's challenges began in school, where bullying over her appearance made her feel unattractive and insecure. She described how being called names like moti (meaning \"fat\" in Hindi) and the remarks about her facial hair took a toll on her mental health. These experiences led to a difficult journey with body image and confidence.\nFrom Bullying to Business Success\nDespite her early struggles, Namita went on to achieve tremendous success. Born into a conservative Gujarati family, she now holds a net worth of around Rs 600 crores. She earns primarily through her role at Emcure Pharmaceuticals but also has multiple income streams. These include her own business ventures, earnings from her role on Shark Tank India, and returns from her investment portfolio.\nNamita's story is a powerful reminder of how childhood experiences can shape a person. However, her success also highlights the possibility of overcoming hardships and finding strength. She continues to inspire many by openly discussing her journey, showing that success is not just about business acumen but also about resilience and self-acceptance.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

Our relationship has been a very one.\"\nSagar Malik\nUpdated : Mar 07, 2025, 11:15 AM IST\nUnited States President Donald Trump has said he is pressing pause on tariffs he recently imposed on imports from neighbouring Mexico, after holding talks with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo.\nThe 78-year-old president, who stormed back to power in January, said fresh tariffs against Mexico would be halted under a deal between the US, Mexico, and Canada, until at least April 2.\n\u201cI did this as an accommodation, and out of respect for, President Sheinbaum. Our relationship has been a very good one,\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social, a social media platform he owns.\nHowever, ties with the US\u2019 other neighbour, Canada, remained troubled as Trump accused Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of using the ongoing tariffs dispute to stay in power. Trudeau had announced his resignation in January and is expected to step down after a replacement is chosen by his party.\n\u201cOur goal remains to get these tariffs, all tariffs removed,\u201d the Canadian PM said in a statement.\nEarlier this week, the US\u2019 25% tariffs on both the neighbours had kicked in, sending global markets into turmoil.\nBesides Mexico and Canada, Trump has also imposed sweeping tariffs on China, hinting that trade taxes would be a key aspect of his foreign policy. Trump says the tariffs will boost US production, protect domestic jobs, and grow the American economy.\r\n\tHe had earlier said the import taxes were a way to stop illegal immigration and trafficking of the deadly drug fentanyl.\nMore recently, Trump has indicated plans to impose \u201creciprocal tariffs\u201d \u2013 tailored to each trading partner of the US \u2013 to tackle trade practices considered unfair by Washington.\nHowever, many economists warn that tariffs could lead to price rises for customers in the US while triggering severe economic crises in Mexico and Canada.\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Anupamaa' Star Rupali Ganguly Joins BJP, Says 'Big Fan' Of PM Modi\nSalman Khan House Firing Case: Accused Anuj Thapan Dies By Suicide In Mumbai Police Custody\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Congress' Rahul Gandhi-Amethi Suspense Making BJP Nervous? | Uttar Pradesh\nDelhi Bomb Threat: Who Is Behind The Hoax Bomb Threat That Shut Down Hundred Schools In Delhi?\nBangladesh Protest: Unreal Scenes In Country After fresh Wave Of Protests |Sheikh Hasina"

        "Key changes and deadlines in March: What you need to know",
        "As the financial year draws to a close, individuals and investors must stay updated on changes and deadlines that take effect in March. From tax filings to UPI payment rules, here\u2019s what you need to know to make informed financial decisions.\nUpdated ITR (ITR-U) filing deadline | If you made errors in your previous Income Tax Return (ITR) or missed reporting income, you can still rectify it by filing an updated return (ITR-U). The deadline for filing an updated ITR for FY2022-23 is March 31, 2025. Missing this deadline means losing the opportunity to correct errors and report omitted income.\nTax-saving investments | For taxpayers, March 31, 2025, is the last date to invest and claim deductions. Key deductions under the Income Tax Act include: Section 80C: Investments in PPF, ELSS, NSC, and life insurance premiums (limit of \u20b91.5 lakh per year);\u00a0 Section 80D: Health insurance premium deductions; Section 24(b): Home loan interest deductions; NPS Contributions (80CCD(1B)): Additional \u20b950,000 deduction. Missing the deadline could result in higher tax liabilities for those following the old tax regime.\nUAN activation for EPFO members | Employees under the Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) must activate their Universal Account Number (UAN) by March 15, 2025, to avail of insurance benefits under the Employees\u2019 Deposit Linked Insurance (EDLI) scheme. The scheme offers insurance coverage of up to \u20b97 lakh for EPF members. If UAN activation is pending, members risk losing insurance benefits.\nNew nomination rules for mutual funds and demat accounts | Effective March 1, 2025 SEBI has revised nomination rules for mutual funds and demat accounts to ensure a smooth transfer of assets. Key changes include: Investors can nominate up to 10 individuals. Nomination is mandatory for single-holder accounts to prevent unclaimed assets. Required nominee details include PAN, last four digits of Aadhaar, or a driving license number. Investors must provide the nominee\u2019s contact details, relationship with the account holder, and date of birth (if the nominee is a minor). For joint accounts, assets will transfer automatically to the surviving account holder under the survivorship rule.\nUPI payment rule change for insurance premiums | UPI users will be able to pay insurance premiums using blocked amounts under the Bima-ASBA facility. This feature will ensure that policyholders' funds remain blocked until the insurer accepts the policy proposal. If the insurer rejects the proposal, the blocked amount will be automatically unblocked. This move will be available this month."

        "What is D-Remit in National Pension System?",
        "D-Remit, a crucial feature in the National Pension System (NPS), \u00a0allows subscribers to transfer funds from one NPS account to another seamlessly. This facility helps in simplifying the process for subscribers who wish to move their accumulated funds between different pension accounts. D-Remit is primarily designed for those who switch jobs, change locations, or opt for a different pension fund manager.\nSimplifying Fund Transfers for Subscribers\nD-Remit enables subscribers to seamlessly transfer their accumulated NPS funds without any disruptions. This eliminates the need for the traditional, cumbersome process that once required manual paperwork and involved multiple steps. The feature is intended to ensure continuity in retirement savings, which is crucial for individuals who frequently change jobs or relocate across the country.\nBenefits of D-Remit\nHow D-Remit Works\nUnder D-Remit, subscribers can request a transfer of funds from one NPS account to another through their current NPS account holder or the new account manager. This system reduces the complications involved in manual transfer requests and offers a more streamlined process. Subscribers simply need to initiate the transfer from their online account, making the process far more accessible and convenient.\nRole in NPS Growth and Accessibility\nD-Remit is seen as an important step towards increasing the flexibility and reach of NPS, especially for those working in the private sector or frequently moving across different geographical locations. By simplifying the transfer process, it encourages individuals to invest in NPS with more confidence, knowing that their retirement savings will not be hindered due to job or location changes.\nIn recent years, the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA)\u00a0has been working on several initiatives to make NPS more accessible, with D-Remit being one of the key steps in improving subscriber experience. The system is expected to make it easier for new and existing subscribers to stay enrolled in NPS, improving overall participation in the scheme."

        "Modi goes on Gir safari, spotlights Asiatic lion revival, and renews wildlife conservation pledge",
        "Prime Minister Narendra Modi took a lion safari at Gir Wildlife Sanctuary on World Wildlife Day, highlighting India's efforts to protect Asiatic lions and promote biodiversity conservation.\nModi Starts Safari: Prime Minister Narendra Modi kicked off a lion safari at Gir Wildlife Sanctuary in Gujarat on March 3, 2025, aligning with World Wildlife Day. His visit to the state included this special outing to spotlight conservation efforts. He started early Monday morning, driving through the sanctuary to observe its wildlife.\nSafari Location Details: The safari took place at Gir Wildlife Sanctuary, situated in Gujarat\u2019s Junagadh district, a region famous for its Asiatic lions. This sanctuary serves as a critical habitat for these animals, and Modi\u2019s visit aimed to raise awareness about their preservation.\nOfficials Join Tour: Modi was joined by several ministers and senior forest department officials during the jeep safari at Gir Wildlife Sanctuary. They travelled together through the rugged terrain, observing the lions in their natural environment. Modi took photographs of the animals, capturing their movements and surroundings.\nCommitment to Biodiversity: On World Wildlife Day, Modi renewed his promise to protect the planet\u2019s biodiversity, sharing his thoughts via a post on X. He wrote, \"Today, on #WorldWildlifeDay, let's reiterate our commitment to protect and preserve the incredible biodiversity of our planet.\" He also attached a video showcasing his previous jungle safaris.\nFocus on Species Role: Modi stressed the importance of every species in sustaining ecological balance, a point he made clear in his X post. He stated, \"Every species plays a vital role -- let's safeguard their future for generations to come!\" This call to action aimed to ensure wildlife thrives for years ahead. His words encouraged people to value all forms of life, linking their survival to the health of the planet.\nIndia\u2019s Conservation Efforts: Modi also praised India\u2019s work in wildlife protection during his World Wildlife Day statement. He wrote on X, \"We also take pride in India's contributions towards preserving and protecting wildlife.\" This highlighted national initiatives that have bolstered conservation across the country. He pointed to efforts like habitat restoration and species monitoring as examples of India\u2019s commitment.\nWildlife Board Meeting: At Sasan Gir, the administrative hub of Gir Wildlife Sanctuary, Modi chaired the seventh meeting of the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL) on 3 March 2025. This body, with 47 members, includes representatives from various states, NGOs, and the Chief of Army Staff. They gathered to review and plan strategies for wildlife conservation nationwide.\nProject Lion Explained: The central government introduced Project Lion to safeguard Asiatic lions, which live only in Gujarat. This initiative focuses on restoring lion habitats, engaging local communities in conservation, and advancing research on big cat diseases.\nLion Numbers Grow: The population of Asiatic lions in Gujarat has risen steadily, according to official counts. Numbers grew from 411 in 2010 to 523 in 2015, reaching 674 by June 2020. Their habitat expanded too, from 22,000 square kilometres in 2015 to 30,000 square kilometres in 2020.\nMeeting Forest Staff: After the NBWL meeting, Modi met with women forest staffers at Sasan on 3 March 2025. This took place following his lion safari and a review of Project Lion\u2019s progress. The interaction recognised the vital role these workers play in protecting the sanctuary\u2019s wildlife.\nTemple Prayers: On Sunday, 2 March 2025, Modi visited Somnath temple in Gujarat to offer prayers. This site, revered as the first of 12 Jyotirlingas, holds deep spiritual significance. After the visit, he travelled to Sasan and stayed overnight at Sinh Sadan, a forest guest house managed by the state."

        "Essential items to buy for Holi: A complete shopping list for the festival of colours",
        "Holi, the festival of colours, is one of India's most treasured celebrations. It signifies the victory of good over evil, the approach of spring, and the delight of community. As Holi 2025 approaches, it's time to start organising and collecting the necessary items for a safe and joyful celebration.\nNatural Colours |\u00a0Colours are the heart of Holi, and no Holi celebration is complete without a variety of vibrant colours. It is wise to choose natural and organic colours that are safer for your skin and your health as well as better for the environment. (Image: Shutterstock)\nTraditional Gulal |\u00a0It is a finely powdered pigment, a customary and necessary component of Holi. It is often applied to cheeks and foreheads as a blessing and well-wishes symbol. One can choose fruit-based gulal and bright body paints to bring excitement and fun to the festivities. (Image: Shutterstock)\nPichkaris or Water Guns |\u00a0For children in particular, pichkaris are an essential component of the Holi celebration. Pichkaris come in a variety of sizes to suit every age and taste, from tiny handheld models to massive super soakers. (Image: Shutterstock)\nWater Balloons |\u00a0People of all ages love water balloons, and they are ideal for fun water fights. They are a traditional Holi necessity that enhances the celebrations with an aspect of surprise and excitement. Water balloons are a great way to cool off and inject some fun into the Holi festivities. (Image: Reuters)\nSkincare and Haircare Products| Skin and hair damage may result from the usage of chemicals in Holi colouring. One can use natural products to protect themselves, such as coconut oil, which nourishes the skin and hair and acts as a barrier against colours. (Image: Reuters)\nSweets and Chocolates | Holi specialities like sweets and gujias are the epitome of sweetness and unity. Moreover, they offer a multitude of choices to the people. (Image: Shutterstock)\nHoli Refreshments | Holi parties are incomplete without cool beverages to keep people energised during the celebrations. The traditional Holi beverage Thandai is a must-have for bringing tradition and taste to your festivities. (Image: Shutterstock)\nHoli Gift Hampers |\u00a0Holi is a time to promote happiness and love while giving innovative gift baskets to loved ones. People can present personalised gift baskets filled with essentials like chocolates, candies, and new clothes. (Image: Shutterstock)\nTraditional Ritual Items | A significant custom during Holi is Holika Dahan puja. Eco-friendly materials such as kande and cow dung logs enable individuals to perform this ceremony responsibly while protecting the environment. (Image: PTI)"

        "Why The TikTok Trend \u2018Girl Math, Girl Dinner\u2019 Is Momentous For Women Everywhere",
        "If we try to get to the bottom of why mansplaining and manspreading are problematic behaviours (apart from the obvious reasons of course), it all comes down to one thing; Women have been discouraged from taking up space physically, psychologically and intellectually, for decades.\nTo be honest, we\u2019ve only scratched the surface by calling out manspreading and mansplaining. Intellectually and psychologically, women are still, often, expected to retreat into corners and not express their authentic selves. Why am I saying this? Am I a pessimist? Am I a misandrist? Am I a bitter, single woman, who can\u2019t help but look for a chance to portray women as victims?\nI think I am just a woman who\u2019s tired of seeing women being taken as jokes. Let\u2019s take for instance, this TikTok trend that has taken the world by a storm \u2013 the \u2018Girl Dinner, Girl Math\u2019 trend. Women from all over the world are sharing how they manage their finances and what they eat for dinner under these hashtags. But it\u2019s not just this, the idea behind \u2018Girl Dinner,\u2019 is to discuss the things we women eat when we\u2019re at ease, when we feel like we\u2019re exempt from the judgement of society, of patriarchy, of certain men who may look at our food, give it a disapproving frown and call it \u2018unhealthy.\u2019\n\u2018Girl Dinners\u2019 are about throwing together easy-to-make meals that may even be described as lazy work. And the truth is, that\u2019s the point. We want to be able to do something for our enjoyment, for the nourishment of our taste-buds and bodies without hearing critical comments that most women have grown up hearing. Comments such as, \u2018Wow, you\u2019re such a bad cook.\u2019 Or, \u2018No wonder you\u2019re single, you can\u2019t even cook a proper meal to feed yourself, how will you ever be able to cook for your partner, or children?\u2019\nThe truth is that women are exhausted by trying to be good at things, so that they can serve the people around them. We\u2019d like to be able to make an easy meal without someone telling us we need to \u2018Be better, do better.\u2019\nAnd we also understand that this isn\u2019t an excuse to neglect your health and opt for unhealthy food, this trend is not an invitation to glorify poor eating habits. Rather, it\u2019s an invitation to make peace with the fact that sometimes it\u2019s okay to do the bare minimum. Sometimes, you deserve to give yourself ease, sometimes you deserve to give yourself the permission to be laid back.\nNow, the same applies to the \u2018Girl Math\u2019 trend. It\u2019s not leeway to manage personal finances terribly. It\u2019s an invitation to give yourself the freedom to take ownership of your hard-earned money. \u2018Girl Math\u2019 is about us women handling our finances with a sense of autonomy that may not resonate with people who are conditioned to understand money through the lens of patriarchy.\nBut, if I were to simplify it, I\u2019d best describe it as spending money in a way that has earned you time to save your finances, has earned you the opportunity to extract full use of a high-end product, or spending money in a way where your savings aren\u2019t being impacted.\nSo, though these trends may seem like frivolous little habits that many women may navigate their life with, they\u2019re actually strategic long-term thought processes, that we\u2019re mostly conscious of. And whatever little content that you do see under these hashtags that seems bizarre, is most probably satire that us women have conjured up to joke about our less-than-perfect habits. Because, maybe, just maybe, we know how to not take ourselves so seriously!\nThe truth is that these trends have given hundreds of women the space to be imperfect. Maybe it\u2019s just a silly little trend, but it\u2019s also virtual breathing space for women."

        "Saif Ali Khan Out Of Danger: Here\u2019s Everything That Has Happened So Far",
        "In a shocking turn of events, Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan was injured during a late-night burglary incident at his residence in Bandra. The attack occurred during the early hours of 16 January, when an intruder entered his home and confronted one of the domestic staff. Attempting to step in, Mr. Khan was stabbed multiple times, which includes injuries near his spine.\nThe actor was rushed to Lilavati Hospital, where an emergency surgery was performed to remove the knife fragments. Hospital officials have confirmed that Khan is now stable, moved out of the ICU and is recovering under medical care. The intruder fled the scene, however, and authorities are currently investigating the same. Here\u2019s a complete update on the case.\nAt 2:30 am, Saif Ali Khan was resting with his wife Kareena Kapoor Khan, and two young sons Jeh and Taimur when he heard noise in Jeh\u2019s bedroom. The 56-year-old nanny, Eliyamma Philip alias Lima was the sole witness to the attack and sustained injuries on her right wrist during the fight. She was brought to Bandra police station for further investigation. Describing the incident, she said, \u201cWhen I tried to see who was there, I saw a person coming out of the bathroom and moving towards Jeh Baba\u2019s (Jehangir\u2019s) bed\u201d. She rushed towards Jeh to rescue him, while the armed intruder threatened her not to make noise and give him 1 crore rupees. Saif heard the scuffle and entered the room and the attacker attacked him. When Saif sir came, the accused attacked him with the Hexa blade and then also attacked Geeta (Taimur\u2019s nanny), who had also come and tried to intervene,\u201d Philip said.\nAs per reports, the actor and his nanny Geeta temporarily subdued the attacker and locked him in the room before going to another floor. However, upon returning, they found the room to be empty.\nThe knife hit Mr. Khan\u2019s back, just one millimeter away from his spine, and was rushed to the Lilavati Hospital by his son Ibrahim Ali Khan at 3:30 am. The hospital confirmed to The Indian Express that Saif Ali Khan had sustained six wounds in total. As per Indian Express, \u201cTwo are deep cuts, primarily on his back, with one located near the spine. A minor wound is present on his neck, while the remaining injuries are superficial. The neurosurgery has been completed, and doctors are now proceeding with plastic surgery\u201d. The actor was operated by a team of doctors which included a neurosurgeon and a cosmetic surgeon. The doctors also revealed that if the knife had been a millimeter deep, it would have resulted in saline fluid leakage and put the actor\u2019s life at immense risk.  Dr. Nitin Dange, the neurosurgeon leading the spinal surgery, said, \u201cThe knife, lodged in the thoracic spine, caused a major injury, including a leak in the spinal fluid. We successfully removed the foreign object and repaired the spinal damage to prevent further complications. It was a delicate operation, requiring coordinated efforts from our team,\u201d he stated.\nDr. Niraj Uttamani, Chief Operating Officer of Lilavati Hospital, said, \u201cKhan\u2019s injuries, while severe, were expertly managed by our team.\u201d The actor is currently moved out of the ICU to a special room and recovering steadily.  Out of danger now, he is likely to be discharged in two days.\nDCP Dixit Gedam has confirmed that an FIR has been officially registered against the accused carrying grave non-bailable charges like Section 311, 312, 331(7), and others. The police have deployed ten teams, alongside five specialized crime branch units to investigate Bandra and nearby hotspots. Forensic teams have collected the evidence from Saif\u2019s home and building to track down the attacker. Along with that, the police have also released CCTV images capturing the intruder on the sixth floor of Saif\u2019s house which was last spotted in Prabhadevi.\nThe intruder entered the building using a second entrance which wasn\u2019t high and had a tear on its net, leading to a suspect that an insider facilitated the theft. He used the shaft as he was not spotted using the lifts or lobby. The police have currently detained a suspect at the Bandra police station this morning. However, no arrests have been made till the time of writing\nIn an Instagram post, Kareena Kapoor Khan requested privacy regarding the unfortunate events. Writing on her Instagram story, she shared, \u201cIt has been an incredibly challenging day for our family, and we are still trying to process the events that have unfolded. As we navigate this difficult time, I respectfully and humbly request that the media and paparazzi refrain from the relentless speculation and coverage\u201d.\n\u201cWhile we appreciate the concern and support, the constant scrutiny and attention are not only overwhelming but also pose a significant risk to our safety. I kindly request that you respect our boundaries and give us the space we need to heal and cope as a family. I would like to thank you in advance for your understanding and cooperation during this sensitive time.\u201d she wrote.\nThe actor was paid a visit by many stars and friends including Ranbir Kapoor, Alia Bhatt, Malaika Arora, Karan Johar, Amrita Arora, and Arjun Kapoor. Many of them wished him a speedy recovery on social media. The incident also raised concerns about the safety among the elite neighbourhoods of Mumbai, especially after the constant threats to Salman Khan and killing of Baba Siddique.\n"

        "Ah, the age-old debate: who has it better \u2013 men or women? It\u2019s the kind of argument that pops up at family gatherings, late-night hangouts, or in the comment section of Instagram posts. Someone will inevitably declare, \u201cMen have it so easy!\u201d while another counters with, \u201cTry being a woman for a day!\u201d.\nBut recently, a user on r/AskReddit asked the question \u2013 Men; why do you like being a man? and the responses were both illuminating and unintentionally hilarious. But more than that, it shows why they really don\u2019t want to be a woman. \u201cNo periods.\u201d \u201cI can walk alone at night without worrying.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m never judged for my body hair.\u201d\nWhile most answers were delivered with humor, they inadvertently painted a picture of just how hard it is to be a woman.

        "The lives of the rich are often hidden from plebians like us. We can only fathom what they live like and how they go about their daily lives. So when we found this Reddit thread on the Mumbai subreddit where people who have worked in Mukesh Ambani\u2019s Antilia shared their experiences, it felt like we were close to unravelling a mystery. The responses people shared are unexpectedly enlightening.\nLet\u2019s take a look, shall we?\n1. \u201cWe are expecting a work order soon. Regarding pay, they are good paymasters; provided that you have all your documents and stuff and compliance as per their norms.\u201d \u2013 mohattar\n2. \u201cA friend used to work for them and I heard this from her. Apparently, Nita Ambani sleeps in the morning/noon and wakes up late in the night and that\u2019s when their day starts. All meetings with her used to be at 12 midnight or 1 AM and stuff. I\u2019ve heard from someone who works with their cousins that they\u2019re very particular about watching a movie together every night as a family. Cute.\u201d \u2013 Legitimate-Work5329\n3. \u201cBack when I was a hospitality student, I got to work in Antilia for an event. We were paid \u20b92500 for a six-hour shift and it was a three-day event. We didn\u2019t have to do much, just had to serve almonds, ice creams, appetizers, juices, etc. to guests. Their criteria, however, was very intricate. We had to undergo a full body checkup and COVID tests. They even put us in a hotel nearby for a week before the event as quarantine.\u201d \u2013 archieshahh\n4. \u201cWe had this building security guard a few months back.

They usually showed up late, often taking hours to come.\u201d \u2013 Scientifichuman\n8. \u201cA friend of mine interned at a company which supplied motors for water. Once he went in there with a senior for maintenance, his job was to see and learn. One thing he told me was that they applied stickers to his camera, which change colours when removed. It was pre-covid, so it was apparently smooth for him.\u201d \u2013 sunny9911\n9. \u201cMy ex-boss worked for MDA (Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani \u2013 his team addressed him that). He told us that he behaves like an absolutely normal person who orders bhelpuri or idlis or vadapav during team meetings. He regularly attends his office strictly on time. Of course, he is not easily accessible. But many times, MDA can be seen standing in the queue for lunch at the Reliance canteen at Navi Mumbai. Needless to say, all the canteens serve the best possible vegetarian spread in a highly neat and clean environment.\u201d \u2013 Electronic-Bill-264\n10. \u201cNeeta Ambani is very sweet and loves her kids.

        "Podcast Host\u2019s Rant About North Indian Tourists In Vietnam Has The Internet Screaming \u2018Stereotype Alert\u2019",
        "A podcast host has stirred the pot on social media after sharing his less-than-pleasant encounters with North Indian tourists during his New Year trip to Vietnam.\nRavi Handa, the host of Desi FIRE Podcast, accused them of \u201cruining\u201d his travel experience, sparking a flurry of reactions online.\nRavi Handa kicked off the conversation by explaining why he skipped Goa for his New Year\u2019s getaway. \u201cGoa has too many North Indian tourists, and they ruin the experience,\u201d he said, choosing Vietnam instead. But to his dismay, he encountered what he described as \u201cbad behaviour\u201d from Indian tourists there as well.\nI went to Vietnam for the new year break, and Goa was a choice. But not for the reasons any of you people on twitter go bonkers about. Goa has too many North Indian tourists and they ruin the experience. Even in Vietnam, the only bad behavior was from North Indian tourists.\u2026 https://t.co/CHiZeVRgoT\nFrom cutting lines with excuses like \u201cHum logon ke pass special pass hai\u201d to shouting Bharat Mata Ki Jai in a crowded train, Handa claimed the loud antics were mostly from North Indians. \u201cI even stopped one at the cable car line,\u201d he added, \u201cbut arguing seemed pointless.\u201d\nNaturally, Twitter took sides faster than a tea-seller at an Indo-Pak match. Many users lashed out at Handa for stereotyping North Indians, calling his remarks \u201cracist.\u201d\n\u201cHow did you know they were North Indians?\u201d asked one user, to which Handa replied that the tourists explicitly mentioned being from NCR. Another user pointed out, \u201cThis mentality of dividing North, South, East, and West is why we can\u2019t progress as a society.\u201d\nUber racist comment \ud83e\udd2eHow did you know that misbehaving tourists were North India?You can tell everything about a person by looking at him \ud83e\udd2d\nWhile Handa\u2019s comments did raise eyebrows, they also found some support. Many North Indians chimed in, admitting they\u2019ve witnessed similar behaviour. \u201cMe, being a North Indian myself, always felt ashamed, but now it\u2019s a whole new level of shame!\u201d wrote one user.\nYep. We have to agree that we Indians don't have civics sense (including me). We need to improve. And more people coming out on SM is one such way to nudge us to improve.\nAnother added, \u201cThere was a group of North Indians on a train in Europe, making too much noise in the name of \u2018having a good time.\u2019 All the other Europeans were silent, and only these people were shouting.\u201d\nThe debate has reignited conversations about travel etiquette and the stereotypes associated with Indian tourists abroad. While some argue that bad behaviour knows no region, others believe it\u2019s time to introspect and, well, turn the volume down a notch.\nSo, what do you think? Are these stereotypes justified, or are we simply dividing ourselves further? Let us know in the comments, but, you know, quietly."

The evening was a reminder that no matter the fame, everyone in that stadium was there for the same reason: to be swept away by Coldplay\u2019s spellbinding music. The band will head to Ahmedabad to perform at the Narendra Modi Stadium on January 25 and 26."

        "Indian celebrity weddings are often synonymous with grandeur, extravagant venues, designer outfits, and a star-studded guest list. However, industrialist Gautam Adani took a different approach for his son Jeet Adani\u2019s wedding, opting for simplicity over a grand spectacle.\nJeet Adani tied the knot with Diva Jaimin Shah in an intimate ceremony on February 7, 2025, at the Adani township, Shantigram, in Ahmedabad. The wedding, held at 2 PM, followed traditional Jain and Gujarati customs. Contrary to speculations of a lavish celebration, the Adani family chose a simple wedding, attended only by close friends and family.\nIn a remarkable gesture, the family not only embraced simplicity but also contributed significantly to social causes. Around INR 10,000 crore was donated towards various initiatives in healthcare, education, and skill development.\nOn February 10, 2025, Gautam Adani, Chairman of the Adani Group, announced the launch of Adani Health City (AHC), an integrated healthcare initiative under the Group\u2019s not-for-profit healthcare division.\nThe Adani Group has partnered with ITE Education Services (ITEES) of Singapore to build a skilled workforce catering to industries such as Green Energy, Manufacturing, Hi-Tech, Project Excellence, and Industrial Design. To support this vision, the Adani family has pledged over INR 2,000 crore to establish internationally benchmarked schools of excellence.\nAdani Group also collaborated with GEMS Education to help create the future of an immersive, dynamic, and responsible education system that is inclusive and accessible to all.\nAccording to Gautam Adani, he follows the philosophy of Seva over Self. He believes \u201cService is meditation, service is prayer, and service is the ultimate divine,\u201d which they promote through their various social initiatives in education, healthcare, and skill development."

        "People Share Toxic Things In Desi Culture That Are Normalized & There\u2019s So Much We Are Doing Wrong",
        "There\u2019s always a lot to love about places that we come from, they\u2019re home after all. This means that even our culture is something that we deeply love, despite the flaws; and there\u2019s no denying that there are a lot of flaws. So much of the desi culture boils down to pretending that we are better than the rest, it\u2019s as if we are constantly competing. A lot of our ideas and opinions are problematic in ways that they harm all of us. Yet, we don\u2019t let them go.\nSome people shared similar instances and ideas of our culture that are deeply toxic:\n1. \u201cThe idea that we have to respect people who are older than us \u2013 relatives and family members, solely because they\u2019re older in age. When in fact, the basis for respect should be an individual\u2019s personality \u2013 it should depend on how they are as human beings.\u201d\n\u2013 Anonymous\n2. \u201cYou cannot have a male friend without the family assuming that you\u2019re in a relationship. This is especially true for women, their friendships with men are ruined because of this regressive mindset.\n\u2013 Aaliyah Jain\n3. \u201cPeople think that there\u2019s a specific age bar to get married. So, anytime you reach anywhere nearer that age, relatives and family members start pestering you. This is pressuring and wrong.\u201d\n\u2013 Naman Issar\n4. \u201cSo many parents make it a point to show that they\u2019re doing a favour when they\u2019re there for the children. Most things they do, they do it as an obligation. The mentality that raising a child is a favour is so toxic \u2013 it\u2019s a choice. Children should not be shown that they owe their parents something because they chose to raise a child.\u201d\n\u2013 Manya\n5. \u201cOur society spends too much money on weddings. This is mostly done to show off \u2013 and it\u2019s problematic. In some cases, people start saving money for the women\u2019s wedding when they\u2019re kids. All of this for someone else, when this money could actually be used for the kids\u2019 future or as an investment.\n\u2013 Izhan Saifi\n6. \u201cGossiping is neither normal, nor okay. I don\u2019t understand why desi culture has normalized it.\u201d\n\u2013 Shantanu Ghosh\n7. \u201cThe idea that parents\u2019 love is unconditional, is flawed. They say that they\u2019ll love us for who we are, despite everything. However, it mostly comes down to their terms. They love us when we live on their terms, when we make them happy by doing things they like. They don\u2019t love us for who we are.\u201d\n\u2013 Anonymous\n8. \u201cWe can hardly take other people doing well. Everything is a competition with us, and we only feel like we are successful when other people around us aren\u2019t doing better than us. I\u2019ve hardly seen people being genuinely happy for someone else\u2019s success. This competition is ingrained in our mentality.\u201d\n\u2013 Riya Gill\n9. \u201cWe\u2019re so into pleasing others, and looking a certain way that we don\u2019t even leave situations like a death of someone close. Our rituals and the idea of having to serve \u201cgood food\u201d are deeply toxic.\u201d\n\u2013 Harshit Ailawadi\n\n10. \u201cYou\u2019re expected to follow the guidance of your elder siblings out of respect. However, sometimes that can end up having an adverse affect, especially if the siblings are either narcissistic or abusive.\u201d\n\u2013 Harshita Singh\nA lot to think about, and correct."

        "7 Couple-Friendly Hotel Chains That Won\u2019t Judge You For Being With Your Partner",
        "If you like to travel with your partner, you probably know how difficult finding an accommodation at hotels gets. The process is frustrating, and people definitely don\u2019t make it easy. There are hardly any major chains that allow unmarried couples to book a room together. This, of course, stems from the regressive mindset of our society. However, not being able to book a room at a trustworthy group also means an unsafe experience. So, this is a more important issue than we give it credit for.\nKeeping that in mind, we have made a list of hotel chains that won\u2019t judge you for being with your partner.\n1. Stay Uncle\nThe platform offers hotel booking services with a focus on providing safe and comfortable accommodations for couples in India. The chain even insists at creating a sex-positive space, which is free of judgement. In doing that, it promotes a safe stay for couples who aren\u2019t married. Stay Uncle has hotels in over 40 cities, and it\u2019s ever expanding.\n2. FabHotels\nFabHotels is another chain that is couple-friendly. The hotel group is safe for couples who are unmarried and offers a reliable stay. The booking process is quite simple for this one, so its accessibility is better than a lot of similar chains. There are a list of hotels in different Indian cities, which helps with accommodation when you\u2019re travelling for leisure.\n3. OYO Rooms\nOYO Rooms is probably one of the most known chains when it comes to hotel stay that is safe and easy for couples who are unmarried. The good part about most of the hotels under the chain is that they are affordable \u2013 this increases the accessibility which a lot of hotel chains lack.\n4. Brevistay\nBrevistay has short-stay accommodations, primarily for couples and travelers looking for flexible booking options. The chain offers a number of options in terms of budget, location, and amenities. To make the entire stay and process more comfortable, they have flexible check-in and check-out timings. So, it\u2019s the customers who have control over their stay, and not the other way round.\n5. Mistay\nThis is also a hotel booking platform with flexible check-in and check-out timings. This means that MiStay specializes in enabling travelers, especially couples to reserve hotel rooms for precise timeframes. This makes it perfect for brief stays, stopovers, and different lodging needs. According to the platform, the options are affordable, so booking a hotel with the platform does not come with a significant financial burden.\n6. LuvStay\nLuvStay is known for being couple-friendly and aims to create a comfortable and non-judgmental environment for unmarried couples. The booking platform also offers an app which makes the process simpler. The chain is said to be one of the groups that has finally come up with safe and secure living situations for couples who are unmarried.\n7. Treebo Hotels\nWhile the group had initially started as a hotel chain for travellers, it also included couple friendly hotels under the name. The idea behind the hotel chain\u2019s step is that moral policing often ruins vacation or travel experience for couples who aren\u2019t married. There are hotels in different cities, so that\u2019s another plus.\nWhile nothing changes how unmarried couples are treated for living together in our society, this is the bare minimum that can help."

        "Elon Musk might have achieved several feats throughout his career, however, it is essential to step away from worshipping him like a hero and examine his actions. It is now high time to assess the man behind the massive headlines and discuss the reality.\nIn the list below, we have mentioned some compelling reasons why people should stop treating this business magnate like a hero. Read on.\n1. He\u2019s a man-child.\nFrom changing its name and charging $8 per month for blue ticks to changing the iconic blue bird to the viral doge, the man has made a joke of his micro-blogging website, Twitter. Recently, the man shared a private picture of his ex, Amber Heard, dressed as a video game character. I mean how childish and ridiculous a man can get?\n2. He has made some very insensitive statements.\nThe man, on several occasions, has said some heartless things. In 2020, he called the people \u2018dumb\u2019 to worry about the deadly coronavirus. In 2022, when Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, he came up with a bizarre list of suggestions to solve the war, through an insensitive poll on Twitter.\n3. He\u2019s sexist and homophobic.\nNeedless to mention, he also has a terrible sense of humor. In 2021, he proposed opening a school called the Texas Institute Of Technology & Science. To this, a person suggested swapping the words \u2018technology\u2019 and \u2018science\u2019. The magnate declined and said that he wanted the name to begin with the letter T \u2013 that\u2019s because the school\u2019s name makes the acronym TITS. He has also made some homophobic statements over time and made fun of people for writing pronouns in their social media bios.\n4. He has no respect for his own employees.\nIt\u2019s 2023 and the man is still promoting the toxic hustle culture. Last year, in 2022, his employees received an ultimatum from him at two in the morning which stated that their work lives would look very different now. His email said that the employees can either commit to the new \u2018hardcore culture\u2019 or leave with three months\u2019 notice. In another instance, he laid off the janitors from his office and made the employees bring their own toilet paper. He also fired an engineer over his low reach on Twitter.\nIt\u2019s high time that we stop hailing a man-child like him as a hero!"

        "It has been five years since the world witnessed a global pandemic that caused seven million deaths globally. Recently, unverified videos of hospitals across China have emerged showing overcrowded emergency rooms due to the alleged spread of HMPV. The visuals, reminiscent of the early days of COVID-19 have raised global concerns, with panic among the masses.\nWhile there is no official information from the WHO regarding the cases, the internet is circulating with a lot of reports about the virus and its potential risk. Here is everything you need to know about the virus, its symptoms, transmission, treatments, prevention, and the current situation in India.\nAccording to the Cleveland Clinic, human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a virus causing symptoms similar to a cold. The cases are usually mild and children, those with weakened immune systems, and adults over the age of 65 face a higher risk of contracting such diseases. It was first identified in 2001 and generally causes both lower and upper respiratory tract infections.\nThe symptoms of HMPV are very similar to those of the common cold and include cough, fever, runny or stuffy nose, sore throat, wheezing, shortness of breath, and even rash. Severe cases can escalate to serious respiratory diseases pneumonia, asthma flare-ups, or make chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) worse, requiring medical intervention. The mild cases last for a few days or a week, whereas serious cases can last longer. People are more likely to get sick the first time, therefore children are at more risk. Later getting some immunity, they develop only mild symptoms if they the HMPV next time.\nThe spread of the virus occurs through respiratory droplets getting transferred through coughing or sneezing. It can also travel through close personal contact through handshakes or hugs or coming in direct contact with contaminated surfaces such as railings, handles, knobs, or washroom basins.\nThere aren\u2019t any antiviral medications that treat HMPV. Mild symptoms are usually manageable at home, however, serious complications require hospital admission and remain under constant care. No antibiotics have yet proven to treat HMPV, since it is a virus.\nThe transmission, however, can be prevented with care and precautions.\nAt the time of writing, India has officially reported two cases of HMPV in Bengaluru \u2013 a 3-month-old and an 8-month-old. However, the infants have no travel history. According to ICMR, \u201cIt is emphasized that HMPV is already in circulation globally, including in India, and cases of respiratory illnesses associated with HMPV have been reported in various countries.\u201d However, the top medical body also noted that India is well-equipped to handle any potential increase in illnesses. As of Friday, the Union Health Ministry also stated that it was closely monitoring the alleged outbreak of Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) in China."

        "Imagine spending \u20b950 lakh in a year on traveling and calling it a lifestyle shift. That\u2019s exactly what travel influencer Sharanya Iyer did, and naturally, the internet has opinions.\nIn a now-viral Instagram reel titled \u201cHow Much I Spent in 2024\u201d, Sharanya revealed her jaw-dropping expenses, breaking down how she managed to globe-trot across six countries, buy a brand-new car, and still keep a smile on her face.\nSharanya, who boasts a following of over 503K on Instagram, shared that she visited countries like Laos, Thailand, South Africa, Greenland, Madeira, and Iceland not once but three times in 2024. Her travels alone cost her a fortune, with flights setting her back \u20b95 lakh and trips like South Africa with her parents reaching \u20b98 lakh.\nHowever, the real kicker? She also splurged \u20b922 lakh on a new Hyundai car and spent \u20b95 lakh on medical expenses her insurance didn\u2019t cover. Surprisingly, she admitted she didn\u2019t even include costs for food, shopping, or daily expenses in her calculations.\nIn the reel, Sharanya explained that this massive shift in her spending philosophy came after years of being an \u201cobsessive saver.\u201d She credited her dad and friends for pushing her to loosen her purse strings and embrace a more joyful approach to life, calling it a \u201csignificant move\u201d that helped her get through a difficult year. While her admission of spending \u20b950 lakh on travel and lifestyle changes was meant to inspire, it left the internet divided.\nA post shared by Instagram (@instagram)\nHer post quickly went viral, amassing over 1.3 million views and countless reactions. Some were curious about her finances, asking questions like, \u201cWhat\u2019s your source of income?\u201d Others couldn\u2019t wrap their heads around her budget, particularly how she managed three trips to Iceland for just \u20b92.5 lakh. Sharanya responded to one such comment, explaining that parts of her Iceland trips were sponsored, and she excluded flight costs.\nBut not all reactions were positive. Many questioned the sustainability of such extravagant spending, with one user humorously pointing out, \u201cFinance influencers are experiencing trauma after this reel.\u201d Still, some applauded her bold approach, agreeing that sometimes, it\u2019s okay to prioritize experiences over savings.\nSharanya\u2019s reel also touched on her decision to focus on cutting down material spending in 2025, a move that seems ironic considering her lavish 2024. But hey, if anyone\u2019s living the dream of turning wanderlust into a lifestyle, it\u2019s her.\nSo, would you blow \u20b950 lakh in a year to chase your adventures, or are you more team save every penny?

        "They Might Always Be On Your Screens Now, But These 9 Celebrities Have Ditched Smartphones",
        "Gone are the days when people needed their morning newspaper when the dawn broke. Nowadays, people need their morning dose of Instagram right after waking, even with squinted eyes. In this era of social media where likes and shares have become the currency of validation, you must be hardly seeing anyone around without a smartphone.\nHowever, there are some celebrities, who are not the biggest fan of smartphones. Forget smartphones, some of them are averse to using cell phones of any kind altogether. Despite being in show business, from cinema to sports, and often appearing on our phone screens, they have chosen a rather tech-free life. Professional disturbances, personal distraction \u2013 the reasons are many, but here\u2019s a list of some of them who have escaped our favourite little black mirrors.\nIn a world where an actor\u2019s stardom decides the box office of a movie, few directors pull crowds to the theaters. And Nolan\u2019s name arguably would top that list. However, I was shocked to learn that the influential director doesn\u2019t use a smartphone. Not only that, he doesn\u2019t have an email ID and refrains from using the internet. He has also banned the use of phones on his sets, for the cast and crew.\nThe Shape of You singer revealed that he decided not to keep a phone in 2015 because he was losing real-life interaction. his team gives him a phone when needed. He explained that the constant back-and-forth of messaging and the pressure of responding on time led him to adopt a phone-free lifestyle.\nThe singing sensation once revealed that he doesn\u2019t have a mobile phone, instead, he uses an\u00a0iPad\u00a0for communication. Bieber said he does this to limit the means of communication, \u201cI definitely learned how to have boundaries, and I just don\u2019t feel like I owe anybody anything,\u201d\nThe veteran actor of Dune and Pulp Fiction said that he continues to embrace a tech-free lifestyle. He doesn\u2019t use a cell phone and watches movies and shows on physical DVDs. He says he has never used emails or Twitter.\nThe Kahaani and Jagga Jasoos actor said in an interview that he once bought a smartphone and had WhatsApp and Instagram accounts made. However, he rarely used to check them because he felt they were distracting him from life and work. Now if he goes to a remote area, he carries a simple phone.\nThe CEO of Berkshire Hathaway and a minor owner of Apple shares was a long-term user of a $20 (1,438 approximately) Samsung SCH-U320 flip phone. He finally decided to ditch his old and upgraded to an iPhone 11 in 2020 at the age of 89.\nWell, we had to mention MS on this list because of all the anecdotes we hear from his team-mates. They say it\u2019s practically impossible to contact him via a phone when MS is away. The former Indian captain had said in an event in 2023, \u201cI do have a phone but I use it only to set an alarm at night. It does the job of waking me up in the morning.\u201d He was recently seen using a smartphone in a practice session, but many fans pointed out that he was just swiping notifications.\nRare video of MS Dhoni using Mobile that too in the net session \ud83d\ude01\u2764\ufe0f#MSDhoni #IPl2025 pic.twitter.com/0IgzQi2QZz\nMusic legend Sir Elton John has been vocal about his disdain for cell phones over the years. He does not even own a mobile phone and says that his husband David Furnish runs his Instagram. He credits his social media presence to his team. \u201cI don\u2019t have a phone. The office staff runs Twitter for me. I don\u2019t do it myself,\u201d Elton once said.\nThe star of Divergent and The Fault in Our Stars revealed way back that she was not a big technology fan. In fact, she revealed that she didn\u2019t even have a cellphone. Shailene said that if she were to have a phone, it would have been a flip one. According to her, there\u2019s a lack of privacy, camaraderie, and community than there\u2019s ever been, which is one of the reasons for her decision.\nWell, to most of us dropping off our smartphones sounds like a nightmare. However, if we took some time off doom-scrolling, the world may appear a little less doomed.\n"
